"My blue horizon is turning grey
And my dreams are drifting away

Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

Your words don't mean what they used to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci
With tears in my eyes

You look the same, you're a lot the same
But my heart says ""no, no, you're not the same""
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci
With tears in my eyes

You look the same, you're a lot the same
But my heart says ""No, no, you're not the same""
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love"
"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

And may all your Christmases be white (all your Christmases be white)
And may all your Christmases be white (all your Christmases be white)
And may all your Christmases be
(All your Christmases be white)
(All your Christmases be white)"
"I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
And I'd like to know it's more than love at first sight
And I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yea yea

I want a a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody
Someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads to no where
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do my Sunday dreaming, oh yea
And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day

Oh I'm hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms need someone
Someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
Love for all my life to have and to hold
Oh and I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yea yea yea

I don't want a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, or Thursday, Friday or Saturday
Oh nothing but Sunday oh yea
I want a Sunday Sunday
I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yea
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday kind of love"

"A-tisket a-tasket
A brown-and-yellow basket
I sent a letter to my mommie
On the way I dropped it

I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes, on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And put it in her pocket

She was truckin' on down the avenue
With not a single thing to do
She went peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground

She took it, she took it
My little yellow basket
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I will die

A-tisket a-tasket
I lost my yellow basket
And if that girlie don't return it
Don't know what I'll do

Oh dear I wonder where my basket could be
(So do we, So do we, So do we, So do we, So do we)
Oh gee I wish that little girl I could see
(So do we, So do we, So do we, So do we, So do we)

Oh why was I so careless with that basket of mine
That itty-bitty basket was a joy of mine

A-tisket a-tasket
I lost my yellow basket
Won't someone help me find my basket
And make me happy again

(Was it green?) No, no, no, no
(Was it red?) No, no, no, no
(Was it blue?) No, no, no, no
Just a little yellow basket

A little yellow basket."
"There ain't nothin' I can do, or nothin' I can say
That folks don't criticise me,
But I'm going to do just as I want to anyway,
And don't care if you all despise me!

If I should take a notion
To jump into the ocean,
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, do, do!

If I go to church on Sunday,
Then just shimmy down on Monday,
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, if I do!

If my friend ain't got no money,
And I say, ""Take all mine, honey"",
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, do, do do!

If I give him my lasy nickel,
And it leaves me in a pickle,
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, if I do!

There, I'd rather my man was hittin' me,
Than to jump right up and quittin' me,
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, do, do do!

I swear I won't call no copper
If I'm beat up by my papa,
'T'aint nobody's business if I do, if I do!"
"I heard church bells ringing,
I heard a choir singing.
I saw my love walk down the aisle.
On her finger, he placed a ring, oh, oh.

I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man.
I heard them promise 'til death do us part.
Each word was a pain in my heart.

Oh. All I could do, all I could do was cry.
All I could do was cry.
I was losing the man that I loved,
and all I could do was cry.

And now the wedding is over,
rice has been thrown over their heads.
For them, life has just begun but mine is at an end

Oh. All I could do, all I could do was cry.
All I could do was cry.
I was losing the man that I loved,
And all I could do was cry."
"Out on the street
The summer heat
Boys playing games
Changing their names
Pulling tricks
Getting their kicks
All the way down
Let it ride

Meeting the stars
In funky bars
Shiny new cars
And back door lies
Trying to hike
Or any other type of ride
All the way down
Let it ride

Trying everything now
Gotta check it out
Trying everything now
Gotta check it out
Hey girl!
You want a blow?
Why not?
I got no where to go

Says don't be a whino
Try these here flakes
They got what it takes
To make you a star
And change who you are
All the way down
Let it ride

Tell me were you satisfied?
Did you mix it?
Did you like it?
Oh! tell me was it good to you
I wanna know did you make enough money?
Did you make enough money to go down in style?
Or did you find yourself just dying
Dying, dying, dying, after a while?

Got to get off!
Got to get off!
I got to, got to, got to, got to, got to get off!
Please help me, help me!
To git off now, now!
Before I freeze, and before I can come up off my knees
And lose my key to freedom
And I go, all the way down, all the way down"

"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

I, I sometimes wonder
Why I never hear from you

You promised to write me
Each and everyday
And I haven't heard from you
Since you went away

Oohh oohh

I sit by my window pane
Hoping for a letter
One that never came

My heart cries for just
One little line
Anything to say you're mine

Oohh, oohh, oohh, oohh

I said a prayer
Every night, hoping
Hoping and praying
Someday, someday you'd write

Oohh, oohh

My heart cries 
For one little line

Anything to say you're mine"

I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking

You better stop your stallin'
It's intermission in a minute
So you better get with it

Dance with me Henry
You better dance while the music goes on
Roll on, roll on, roll on
Oooooooo-wee

Henry, you ain't movin' me
You better feel that boogie beat
And get the lead out of your feet
You gotta dance with me Henry

Dance with me Henry
Rock with me Henry
Talk to me Henry
Dance with me Henry
You better dance while the music goes on

Roll roll roll
Roll roll roll
Rock rock rock
Rock rock rock
Roll roll roll

Jump with me Henry (all right)
You better dance, dance
While the music goes on

Roll on
Roll on
Roll on
Roll on

"All I need
Is someone like you
My dearest darling
Please love me to

Within my heart 
I pray your answer's yes
I'll make your life
Full of happiness

When you need me
I'll be there by your side
Oh I pledge my love to you
With God as our guide

Oh nothing, nothing, nothing in this world
Can keep us apart
Unh, my dearest darling
I offer you my heart

Oh, yeah whenever you need me
I'll, I'll be there by your side
Oh I pledge my love to you
With God as our guide

Oh nothing, nothing, nothing in this world
Can keep us apart
Unh, my dearest darling
I offer you my heart
Unh, my dearest darling"
"Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
Don't you know, I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I'm been untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And baby you never will"
"Take me to heart and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leaving love unsure
Makes will power weak and temptation strong
 
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man

They say that it's a man's world
Well you can improve that by me
And as long as we're together baby
Show some respect for me

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man"
"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me."
"Don't cry, don't cry baby
Don't cry baby
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, 'cause you know 
You know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

And oh, don't cry 
Don't cry baby
Don't cry, don't cry
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, 'cause you know, you know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

Don't cry, don't cry baby
Don't cry baby
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, 'cause you know

To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again"
"Hush now don't explain
I know you raise Cain
I'm glad you're back
Don't explain

Quiet, don't explain
You mixed with some dame
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you and what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry to hear folks chatter, and I know you cheat
But right and wrong don't matter when you're with me sleep

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours love
Don't explain"
"Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
 
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up memories?
 
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't get around much anymore"
"Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone true to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me

Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me

For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all and I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go

So make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, come on to me

Oh, make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling, come on to me

"Don't let my baby ride
Oh no don't, don't let my baby ride

"Tear a star from out the sky and the sky feels blue
Tear a petal from the rose and the rose weeps too
Take your heart away from mine and mine will surely break
My life is yours to take, so please keep the spark awake

Would you take the wings from birds so that they can't fly?
Would you take the ocean's roar and leave just a sigh?
All this, your heart won't let you do
This is what I beg of you
Don't take your love from me

All this, your heart won't let you do
This is what I beg of you
Don't take your love from me
Don't take your love from me"
"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me"

"Dream when you're feeling blue
Dream that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
And I know you'll find your child memories there

So dream when the day is through
Oh, dream and they might come true
And things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

Dream when you're feeling blue

When I begin to realize
I've cried so much since you've been gone
I guess I'll drown in my own tears

I've been crying just like a child
My pouring tears are running wild
If you don't think you'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown, oh yeah, in my own tears

I know it's true
Into each life
Oh, some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue
Here without you
It keeps raining more and more

"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moon"
"Dozens of guys would storm up;
I had to lock my door,
Somehow I couldn't warm up
To one before.
What was it that controlled me?
What kept my love-life lean?
My intuition told me
You'd come on the scene.
Baby, listen to the rhythm of my heartbeat,
And you'll get just what I mean.

Embrace me,
My sweet embraceable you.
Embrace me,
You irreplaceable you.
Just one look at you, my heart grew tipsy in me.
You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me.
I love all
The many charms about you;
Above all,
I want my arms about you.
Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you.

Every little bit hurts
Every night I cry
Every night I die

You treat me cold
Yet you won't let me go
Every little hurt does
Every little hurt does
To you I am a toy
And you're the girl
Who has the say
Why I should play 
Yeah you hurt me
Desert me I just can't take
The loneliness you give me
I just can't go
Another night this way
Come back to me

I can give you all the things
You wanted me for

"The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean
But you don't care how many tears I cry
And though you only lead me on and hurt me
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

'Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

I told myself it's best that I forget you
Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts, but I'd come running back for more

'Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

Someday you'll find someone you really care for
And if her love should prove to be untrue,
You'll know how much this heart of my is breakin'
You'll cry for her the way I cried for you

And there are no exceptions to the rule

For falling in love with you.
And a, fool that I am,
For thinking you loved me, too.

Then played the part of little coquette.
And, all my dreams just disappeared
Like the smoke from a cigarette.

Fool that I am,
For hoping you'd understand.
And thinking you
Would listen, too,
And, oh, the things I had planned.

But we couldn't see eye to eye
So, darling, darling, darling,
This is goodbye.
But I still care, but I still care,
And oh, fool that I am.
Oh, but I still care,
Fool that I am."
"Dear, it seems years since we parted,
Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.
 
It's strange how life deals you sorrow,
Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,
But sometimes the learning comes high:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.

"Cain slew Abel, Seth knew not why
For if the children of Israel suppose to multiply
Why must any of the children die
So he asked the Lord and the Lord said
Man means nothing he means less to me
Than the lowliest cactus flower or the humblest yucca tree
He chases round this desert 'cause he thinks that's where I'll be

That's why I love mankind
I recoil in horror from the foulness of thee
From the squalor and the filth and the misery
How we laugh up here in Heaven, prayers you offer me
That's why I love mankind
The Christians and the Jews were having a jamboree
The Buddhists and the Hindus joined on satellite TV
They picked their four greatest priests
And they began to speak
They said Lord the plague is on the world
Lord no man is free
The temples that we built to you have tumbled into the sea
Lord, if you won't take care of us
Won't you please please let us be
And the Lord said
And the Lord said
I burn down your cities, how blind you must be
I take from you, your children and you say how blessed are we
You all must be crazy to put your faith in me
That's why I love mankind, you really need me
That's why I love mankind"

Wrong because I love him deeply
Wrong because I'm his completely

"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay

So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way."
"I can't believe that it's real, 
The way that you make me feel. 
A burning deep down inside, 
A love that I cannot hide. 
Our love is you and me baby, 
That makes the world go round. 
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me, 
Layin' all my troubles down, 
Here I am, baby, 
Come and take me. 
Here I am, baby, 
Come and take me, 
Take me by the hand. 
Show me, 
Here I am, baby. 

It always ends up this way, 
Me begging you every day. 
A love that I cannot have, 
You broke my heart into half. 
Our love is you and me baby, 
That make's the world go round. 
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me, 
Layin' all my troubles down, 
Here I am, baby, 
Come and take me,

Show me, 
Here I am, baby. 

When I'm down I can always call you, 
For a helpin' hand. 
I know you'll do the best you can. 
But it don't take much from me, 
Just my cup of joe. 
Oh there's love inside me, 
I believe there's one to be explodin', 
It's tough for me, oh baby, 
I can do worry, 
Tell me all your troubles. 
You won't ever have to worry now, 
Just one more thing, ask everybody, 
Everybody you see, 
You'll find yourselves lost and alone on a darkened street, 
Here I am, baby, 
Come and take me. 
Here I am, baby, 
Come and take me, 
Take me by the hand. 
Show me, 
Here I am, baby"

Success has come to lots of them, and failure's always there
Time, time waits for no one and I wish, how I wish someone would care

Some folks think you're happy, when you wear your smile
What about your tribulations, and all, all of your trials
Smiles, smiles hide a lots a things
The good, the bad, the hurt, all of this goes too
And I wish, how I wish, how I wish someone would care
I wish someone would care
Don't you think someone should care?
Ah don't you think someone should care?
Sit down and think about yourself
Ah don't you think someone should care?
Mm, don't you think someone should care?
Ah don't you think someone should care?"

That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, the chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning' sun

And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun

And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

My pouring tears are running wild

I guess I'll drown, oh yeah, in my own tears

I know it's true
Into each life
Oh, some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue
Here without you
It keeps raining more and more

Why don't you come home so I won't be all alone
If you don't think you'll be home soon
I Guess I'll (drown in my own tears

I'll fly away

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end

I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, hallelujah, bye and bye

Gonna turn my back on love, gonna snub the moon above
Seal all my windows up with tin, so the love bug can't get in

I'm gonna park my romance right along the curb
Hang a sign upon my heart, 'Please don't disturb'
And if I never fall in love again that's soon enough for me

I would keep a place just to set your picture
Reach out to touch your face and feel you in my arms
And I wouldn't be here now parked outside your house
Not ashamed to crawl oh if I had any pride left at all

And only a fool would still be wearing this ring
Ringing your front doorbell

And I wouldn't let my heart stay wrapped around your finger
And I wouldn't fall apart when you open the door
Like all the other times when your eyes met mine
These teardrops wouldn't fall

On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride

I had no way of knowing
What would come from our first kiss
It scares me now to think about
The good love that I might have missed

I was just tryin' to find some help
Tryin' to see myself as a survivor
I had to rise up from the ashes of love
And jump back into the fire

Sometime, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yeah

Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith

Sometimes, you gotto believe

Can be like a heavenly dream

Is your mouth a little weak?

Are you smart?

Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more"
"My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again
To my old flame
My old flame
My new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent

So innocent or elegant
As my old flame

I've met so many men
With fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who sent me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became
Of my old flame

I've met so many men
With fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who sent me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became
Of my old flame"
"My one and only,
What am I gonna do if you turn me down
When I`m so crazy over you?

I`d be so lonely
Where am I gonna go if you turn me down
Why blacken all my skies of blue?

I tell you, I`m not asking any miracle
It can be done, it can be done
I know a clergyman who will grow lyrical
And make us one, and make us one

So, my one and only
There isn`t a reason why you should turn me down
When I`m so crazy over you

I tell you, I`m not asking any miracle
It can be done, it can be done
I know a clergyman who will grow lyrical
And make us one, and make us one

So, my one and only
There isn`t a reason why you should turn me down
When I`m so crazy over you

Oh, I`m so crazy over you"
"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hideaway, no soft guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance doesn't need a thing but you

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake, wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance doesn't need a thing but you

"
"You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love
Never my love

You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never my love
Never my love

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
On you (on you)

Never my love
Never my love

You say you fear I'll change my mind
And I won't require you
Never my love
Never my love

How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life
With me (with me, with me)"
"Sorrow
Is the street that I'm living on
Across pain avenue
In a town call moan
The people I see are sadder than me
A river of tears
Don't you know it flows by my door

And I'm living
(next door to the blues)
Yes I'm living
(next door to the blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move
Oh lord
Next door to the blues

Memory
You can tell it in my talk
My heart hurts
Even when I walk
I cry on
A pillar made of stone
Pity is my name
And that thing called love is to blame

And I'm living
(next door to the blues)
Yes I'm living
(next door to the blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move, oh lord
Next door to the blues

Bittersweet
Is the food that I cook
My only joy is in a storybook
The talk I give
Every word brings a tear
Every hello
Just ends with a sad goodbye

And I'm living
(next door to the blues)
Yes I'm living
(next door to the blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move, oh lord
Next door to the blues"
"Like the beat, beat, beat,
Of the tom-tom;
When the jungle shadows fall,
Like the tick, tick, tock
Of the stately clock,
As it stands against the wall,
Like the drip, drip, drip,
Of the raindrops,
When the summer show'r is through;
So a voice within me
Keeps repeating,
You, you, you

Night and day
You are the one,
Only you 
Beneath the moon
And under the sun.
Whether near to me or far,
It's no matter, 
Darling, where you are
I think of you
Night and day.

Day and night 
Why is it so,
That this longing for you follows
Where-ever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom,
In the silence of my lonely room,
I think of you,
Night and day.

Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an 
Oh, such a hungry yearning,
Burning inside of me.
And its torment won't be through
Til you let me spend my life
Making love to you,
Day and night,
Night and day."
"I got to have all your love, night and day.
Not just a little part, but all of your heart, sugar.

[Chorus]
Ninety-nine and a half just won't do.
Oh, no, no, just won't get it.

Don' t be led in the wrong direction.
To start this thing off right, a man need a little love and affection,
Yes he do, now.

[Chorus]

All right. Lookie here,

We got to bring it all down, start gettin' it right.
We got to stop this messin' around, and keep the thing up tight,
Yes we do, now.

[Chorus]

All right, sugar.
Got to have a hundred,
Got to have a hundred.
All right.
Ooh, I must do, I must do,
I must do now. 

Oh! Got to have a hundred!
Got to have a hundred!
Oh! Got to have a hu-hu-hu-hu-hu-hundred, too right.
Got to have a hundred, now. Oh!"
"O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!"
"Oh happy day (oh happy day)
Oh happy day (oh happy day)
When Jesus washed (when Jesus washed)
When Jesus washed (when Jesus washed)
When Jesus washed (when Jesus washed)
He washed my sins away (oh happy day)
Oh happy day (oh happy day)

He taught me how to watch, fight and pray, fight and pray
And live rejoicing every, everyday

Oh happy day

He taught me how

Oh happy day (oh happy day)
Oh happy day (oh happy day)
Oh happy day (oh happy day)"
"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown
[ piano ]
Oh that old rugged cross so despised by the world is a wonderous attraction for me
For the dear lamb of God left this glory above to bare it to dark calvary
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross..."
"Now I'm gonna tell you, so you'll understand
How it all got started, how it all begin
God made the heavens, God made the earth
Made a man and a woman out of blood, sweat and dirt
And He looked around the neighborhood
And He said to His self, ""This is good""

God made the rivers and the mountains with his hands
God made the wind to blow the shifting sands
He put the fishes in the, in the deep blue sea
Filled up the garden with flowers and the trees
And God looked around the neighborhood
And He said to His self, ""This is good""

But the devil he was jealous, took the apple in his hand
The devil tempted woman and woman tempted man
God, He mourned and the tears rolled down His face
It broke His heart to see His children fall from grace
And on the seventh day they say, ""God rested""
But you know that ain't the truth

Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue
Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue

The blues is been around ever since that day
Everybody gets the blues, everybody got to pay
For the wicked things we do
And what we put each other through
And on the seventh day they say, ""God rested""
But you know that ain't the truth

Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue
Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue
God made the blue"
"Call me a fool, send me away
I've got to say-ay it's you I adore
Alone and in love, fallin' apart

Straight to your door

Face to face, with all honesty-why

O-one night, to lay-ay in your are-arms
O-one night, could it be that I was born
To make every dream
You ever had come true-ue
Woh-oh, in o-one night
Oh, one night with you-ou

Standin' this close, the sound of your voi-oice
Leaves me no choice, I offer my love
Am I so wrong to think you might fa-all
'Cause baby you're a-a-a-a-all I can think o-of

Face to face, with all honesty-why-why-why-why
I would be grateful if you'd give to me-ee

Oh, one night with you

O-one night, to lay in your are-arms
O-one night, could it be that I was born
For o-one night (one night)
To lay, to lay in your are-arms
O-one night (one night)
Could it be that I was born
For o-one night (one night)
I need one night (one night)

"I just needed someone, somebody to hold
When the bottle was empty
And the nights grew cold
In my hour of darkness

In my time of need
You were my angel of mercy
And helped me to believe
You touched my soul

When I was lonely
You held me up
When I couldn't fly
There's no words could explain

How I feel inside
And this I tell you
In a world full of anger
In times gone strange

You held me close
You held me close to you
Lay my head on your shoulder
I finally let it all out

It felt good for a moment
Not living in a shadow of doubt
But everybody needs a little something
To pull them through

I gave one for the other
And God know that the other was you
Now only time will tell
Only time will tell

If our love is scratched in sand
Or if it's etched in stone
Only time will tell
Only time will tell

If our love will stand
Or walk the road alone
My angel of mercy
Pulled me through somehow

I just hope you know
I need you now
You're the one
That touched my very soul

The one who held on tight
God knows you never let go
Now only time will tell
Only time will tell

If our love is scratched in sand
Or if it's etched in stone
Only time will tell
Only time will tell

If our love will stand
Or walk the road alone
Only time will
Only time will

(Can you bring my hands to yours)
Only time will tell
(Can you teach my soul to fly)

Only time will
Only time will
(Can you save me)

Only time will tell
Angel of mercy
It's time we closed the door
Put out the lights

And burn the fire
Burn the fire inside
Angel of mercy"
"Man's got his woman to take his seed
He's got the power - oh
She's got the need
She spends her life through pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can

She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Man makes your hair gray
He's your life's mistake
All you're really lookin' for is an even break

He lies right at you
You know you hate this game
He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain

She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Black eyes all of the time
Don't spend a dime
Clean up this grime
And you there down on your knees begging me please come
Watch me bleed

Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed"
"Out of the rain, under the shelter
I've been so long where the sun don't shine
Standing at the cross-roads, could have went either way
But now I've found you and the storm is behind

Out of the rain, out of the rain

Over the wall, I'm out in the open
Back on the right tracks, I'm feeling no pain
You took a sparrow and let it fly with the eagles
I can see a long ways I feel love again

Out of the rain, out of the rain

There was a time I was taking no prisoners
Standing with a cold hear, standing alone
It took your sweet love to pull me out of the canyon
I believe I can make it now, I feel like I belong

Out of the rain, out of the rain
Out of the rain, out of the rain
"
"Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man?
Didn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can?

Oh, but the longer love I give you it's never enough
And I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough
So come on, come on, come on, come on

And take it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break it, break another little piece of my heart now, honey
Honey, have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good
(If it makes you feel good)

You're out on the street looking good
Oh, you know, you deep down in your heart that it ain't right
You never ever hear me, you never hear me when I, when I cry at night

Oh, but each time I tell myself I just can't stand the pain
(I can't stand)
But when you hold me in your arms I've seen [Incomprehensible]
Again and again, and again
Come on, come on, come on, come on

Take it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break it, break another little bit of my heart now, honey
Honey, have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good

Take it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby
Break it, break another little piece of my heart now, honey
Honey, have another little piece of my heart now, baby
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good

"Heaven please send to all mankind,
Understanding and peace of mind.
But, if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love.

Show all the world how to get along,
Peace will enter when hate is gone.
But, if it's not asking too much,
Please send me someone to love.

I lay awake night and ponder world troubles.
My answer is always the same.
That unless men put an end to all of this,
Hate will put the world in a flame, (oh) what a shame.
Just because I'm in misery.
I'm not begging for no sympathy.
But if it's not asking too much,
Just send me someone to love.

Heaven please send to all mankind,
Understanding and peace of mind.
But if it's not asking too much,
Please send me someone to love.

Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do
Because strange things are happenin', babe, an' somethin' might happen to you

If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?
If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?
Because it's better to be without you, then to live on in misery

Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too
You better change your ways pretty baby or somethin' might happen to you"
"What gives you the right hey you
To stand there and tell me what to do
Tell me who gave you the power
To stop me from living like I do
Remember if you plan to stay
Those who give can take away
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

Just one time I'd like to be somewhere where 
None of your clever lies fill the air 
I'm tired of your frozen smile and your voice of tin
Just might all gang up on you
Turn the knob and do you in

Remember if you plan to stay 
Those who give can take away.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

This never ending power play
""between Jealous greed and vicious hate 
Is grinding us like giant millstones
But it can't be our only fate 
It's time we got our heads together
And let them know that we're awake

Those in the dark, you know they're no longer blind
They're breaking from your strangle hold on their minds
Those that can see don't need no one to cross the street
Be careful who you're pushing round
They just might find you obsolete

Remember if you plan to stay 
Those who give can take away.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you"
"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss"
"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love. 
Love."

There's no cost and there's no fun

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man await a sax
I must admit the have a rockin' band
Man they were going like a hurricane
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music 

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jockey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup
The folks dancin' they all got shook up
And started playin' that
Rock and roll music 

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that
Rock and roll music"
"I want you to rock me, baby

Rock me, baby, rock me all night long
I want you to rock me, baby, rock me all night long
I want you to rock me, baby, like my back ain't got no bone

Roll me, baby, roll me till you make me feel
I said roll me, baby, roll me till you make me feel
I said roll me, baby now, roll me till you make me feel
And I want you to do this for me, baby

I said roll me, baby now, roll me like you roll a, a big old wheel
I said roll, roll me, baby now, roll me like you roll a big old wheel
'Cause I know that you know, baby, you know how to make me feel

Roll me slow, roll me all night long
I said roll me, roll me slow, baby, roll me all night long
I said I know that you know that
I know that you know how to make me feel

I said rock me, baby, now rock me all night long
Say, baby you rock me, baby, rock me all night long
I said rock me, baby, like
Like my back ain't, my back ain't got no bone

Roll me, baby now, roll me like you roll a big old wheel
Roll me, baby now, roll me, roll me like you roll a big old wheel
I said I know that you know, you know how to make me feel

"
"Just let me hear some of that
Rock and roll music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,

Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be rock and roll music,
If you want to dance with me,
If you want to dance with me.

I've got no kick againt modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast;
And change the beauty of the melody,
Until they sounded like a symphony,
That's why i go for that
Rock and roll music ...

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man await a sax,
I must admit the have a rockin' band,
Man they were going like a hurricane
That's why i go for that

"Lock the door, sun's a fallin'.
Poke the fire, don't let the cold in.
Gonna try to sail away from the rest of my life.

Found a boat to make the break in.
Filled with hope 'bout the step I'm takin'.
Gonna try to sail away from the rest of my life.

Spent a long time list'ning to the captain of the sea,
Shoutin' orders to his crew; no one hears but me.

Cast away, tide's a runnin'

Hoist the sail, strong wind's comin'.
Gonna try to sail away from the rest of my life.

Spent a long time list'ning to the captain of the sea,
Shoutin' orders to his crew; no one hears but me.

Lock the door, sun's a fallin'.
Poke the fire, don't let the cold in.
Gonna try to sail away from the rest of my life.
Gonna try to sail away from the rest of my life."
"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town"

"Silent night! Holy night!
All's asleep, one sole light,
Just the faithful and holy pair,
Lovely boy-child with curly hair,
Sleep in heavenly peace!

Silent night! Holy night!
God's Son laughs, o how bright.
Love from your holy lips shines clear,
As the dawn of salvation draws near,
Jesus, Lord, with your birth!

Silent night! Holy night!
Brought the world peace tonight,
From the heavens' golden height
Shows the grace of His holy might
Jesus, as man on this earth!

Silent night! holy night!
Where today all the might
Of His fatherly love us graced
And then Jesus, as brother embraced.
All the peoples on earth!

Silent night! Holy night!
Long we hoped that He might,
As our Lord, free us of wrath,
Since times of our fathers He hath
Promised to spare all mankind!

Silent night! Holy night!
Sheperds first see the sight.
Told by angelic Alleluja,
Sounding everywhere, both near and far:
""Christ the Savior is here!"""

Don't you hear me callin'?
Don't you hear me callin'? Well, well

Tell me where did you go last night?
I gotta know who you been with
Tell me where did you go last night? Well, well

You gotta stop your train
Let me go for a ride, pretty baby, you know
Stop your train, I gotta ride with you

"You need a job, so you can make some money
You need a nice warm place to stay
A sense of humor 'cause life ain't funny
A big stick keeps the wolves away

You need a car with good tyres on it
The right place to eat barbecue
A heavy duty set of jumper cables
No holes in your walkin' shoes

The main thing you're gonna find, you need
A fertile place to plant your seed

Gotta find somebody to love you
Someone to be there for you night and day
Somebody to share with, be a part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away
You got to give it away

I got to recommend some Life Insurance
Be prepared to dial 911
Pay close attention to your high blood pressure
Stay away from the man with the gun

You need a reason to get up in the mornin'
Make sure the clock got snooze control
Be sure you got a place to run for cover
'Cause overnight things can get real cold

You're gonna find that sooner or later
You need a common denominator

You gotta find somebody to love
Someone to be there night and day
Someone to share with, be a part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away
Oh, give it away

The main thing you're gonna go, what you need
A fertile place where the plant you seed

You got to find somebody to love
Someone to be there for you night and day
Someone to share with, be a part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away

You gotta find somebody to love
Be there for you night and day
Someone to share, be a part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away

Gotta find somebody, you gotta find somebody
Love ain't no good till you give it away
Love ain't no good till you give it away
Love ain't no good till you give it away

You gotta find somebody to love
Someone to be there for you night and day
Someone to share with, be a part of you

Love ain't no good till you give it away
Love ain't no good till you give it away
Gotta give it away, gotta give it away

"There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, ""seek and ye shall find""
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some 
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Someone to watch over me"

"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die"
"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain."
"Ooh, I gotta see you somehow
Not tomorrow, but right now
I know it's late, but honey don't make me wait
So come on, baby, steal away
Oh let's steal away

Don't make me start thinking
'Cause I might change my mind
My folks are sleeping 
So please don't waste no time
I know it's late but please don't make me wait
So come on steal away
Please let's steal away

I know it's wrong, it's wrong needing you this way
But there's no other way I can be with you
If only my folks, if only my folks they would approve
Things like this we wouldn't have to do

Ooh I won't tell, I won't tell anybody else
I'm gonna keep it, I'll keep it to myself
I know it's late, but oh don't make me wait
So come on and steal away
Oh I'm asking you to steal away

Because I need you, I need you by my side
Oh I need you baby, I need you to be my guy

Threw that nasty habit away
Laid down my last dollar on my last bet
Didn't ever win anyway

Gave up the wine and whiskey

Sooner or later you will put me down
Gonna have to face it someday

"In the club tryin' to find me a bad ass broad
Gave her five for the pussy then I took her to the mall

Came up in the hood sellin' fifty dollar slabs

Fifty dollar slab to a trunk full of holes
Never at the house cause I'm always doing shows 
Teamed up with big cat now they want to chit chat
Role to crash raod, flat shoals represent that

Smokin purple weed under shade of palm trees 
In Biloxi we could spend a hundred gees 
I'll play the crap table you get the slot machine

"[Chorus]

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home,
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

I looked over Jordan, and what did I see
Coming for to carry me home?
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

[Chorus]

Sometimes I'm up, and sometimes I'm down,
(Coming for to carry me home)
But still my soul feels heavenly bound.
(Coming for to carry me home)

[Chorus]

The brightest day that I can say,
(Coming for to carry me home)
When Jesus washed my sins away.
(Coming for to carry me home)

[Chorus]

If I get there before you do,
(Coming for to carry me home)
I'll cut a hole and pull you through.
(Coming for to carry me home)

[Chorus]

If you get there before I do,
(Coming for to carry me home)
Tell all my friends I'm coming too.
(Coming for to carry me home)

"All alone at the end of the of the evening
When the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a man who might have loved me
And I never knew

You know I've always
I've always been a dreamer
Spent my life running 'round
And it's so hard to change
Can't seem to settle down

But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same, same
So put me on a highway
And show, show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time, spend all your time making money
Oh and you can spend all, spend all your love making time
But if it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still, would you still be mine?

And when you're looking
When you're looking for your freedom
Nobody seems to care
You can't find the door
Can't find it anywhere

When there's nothing
Nothing to believe in
Still you're running back
You keep coming back
You're running back for more

Put me on a highway
And show me, show me a sign
Take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it, take it to the limit
Take it to the limit

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh no
Oh oh
Take it to limit, one more time"
"Did you say that I've got a lot to learn 
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn 
Since this is the perfect spot to learn 
Teach me tonight 

Starting with the ABC of it 
Getting right down to the XYZ of it 
Help me solve the mystery of it 
Teach me tonight 

The sky's a blackboard high above you 
And if a shooting star goes by 
I'll use that star to write ""I love you"" 
A thousand times across the sky 

One thing isn't very clear my love 
Teachers shouldn't stand so near my love 
Graduation's almost here my love 
You'd better teach me tonight 

I've played loves scenes in a flick or two 
And I've also met a chick or two 
But I still can learn a trick or two 
Hey teach me tonight 

I who thought I knew the score of it 
Kind of think I should know much more of it 
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it 
Hey teach me tonight 

The midnight hours come slowly creeping 
When there's no one there but you 
There must be more to life than sleeping 
Single in a bed for two 

What I need most is post graduate 
What I feel is hard to articulate 
If you want me to matriculate 
You'd better teach me tonight 

What do you get for lessons 
Teach me, come on and teach me, teach me tonight"
"I'm just a fool who really loves you
There is no greater fool than me

How big a fool can you be

I close my eyes when people tell me
They saw you kissin' someone new

I'm just a fool in love with you

Some day you may be crying
Crying over me
And if that ever happens
A fool you too may be

Why don't you change your way of livin'?
And walk the straight and never lie
The Lord forgives a fool who's willin'
I'll give the world to make you mine

Some day you may be crying
Crying over me
And if that ever happens

"The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we

The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly

Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly"

If the clock run down, we'll wind it up again
And that's all, I mean to tell you, that's all
All you have to do is rock and roll and that's all, yeah

You can learn everything they teach you in school
But if you can't rock and roll, you're not a fool

"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!"

"I'm talking to all the lovers in the house tonight
Now listen, you know I want you to find out what's wrong
And get it right, or you should leave love alone
Because the love you save, it might be your own

People, I've been misled and I've been afraid
I've been hit in the head, ohh, and left for dead
I've been abused, woah and I've been accused
Been refused a piece of bread

But I ain't never in my life before
Seen so many love affairs go wrong as I do today

I want you to stop, find out what's wrong
Get it right or leave love alone
Because the love you save today
May very well be your own

I've been pushed around, oh yeah, and I've been lost and found
Given the sundown to get out of town
I've been taken outside, oh and I've been brutalized
I had to always be the one to smile and apologize

But I ain't never in my life before
Seen so many love affairs go wrong as I do today

I want you to stop, find out what's wrong
Get it right or leave love alone
Because the love you save today
Might very well be your own

"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he, for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?
And so, all else above,
I'm waiting for the man I love."
"The night is bitter,
The stars have lost their glitter,
The winds grow colder,
And suddenly you're older
And all because of
The man that got away.

No more his eager call,
The writing's on the wall,
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it's final inning,
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.
Every trick of his you're on to -
But fools will be fools and where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher,
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,
Tomorrow he may turn up.
There's just no letup
The livelong night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away

The road gets rougher,
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,
Tomorrow he may turn up.
There's just no letup
The livelong night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man
The man that got away

The man that got away"
"I said the moon is full, I feel my love comin' down
I said the moon is full, I feel my love comin' down
You see I met this little girl
I don't think I'm gonna want to, want to, leave this town

All my friends call me crazy, you just don't know how I feel inside
All my friends call me crazy, you just don't know how I feel inside
You know I love this little girl, 
'Cause she's got the little pretty, pretty brown eyes

Gonna take that train in the mornin', I think I'm gonna go back home
Gonna catch that train in the mornin' y'all
I think I'm gonna go back home
And I know that my little girl know, oh that I won't be gone
I won't be gone 'till dawn

If I miss that train, I think I'm gonna to have to hitch-hike
If I miss that train in the mornin' y'all
I guess I'm gonna have to hitch-hike
And I'll let my little girl know, I'll just be gone
I'll be gone overnight"
"It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you"
"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love"
"I've got such a crazy feeling 
And I've got to find somewhere to go
I've got such a crazy feeling 
And I've got to find somewhere to go

I've got to find the kind of man
Who knows just how to love me 
Don't you know, don't you know
I beg your pardon, what did you say
Well, yeah

If you're the right kind of man
Man I don't dig your sounds at all
Cadillac's don't excite me
I've got one of my own
And that don't either
Is that all

Well don't be mad
Just cool down now
Don't be so quick to give up
It may happens sooner than you think
Well, I don't know
I've gotta be home by two
Is that a promise
That sounds crazy
Well lets go then"
"When you wake up
In the morning and you wonder
Why no one's beside you where I usually lay
And you think you hear
The sound of a distant thunder
It's just your old rock rolling away

I was your rock standing strong for you
There was nothing I wouldn't do
No matter the cost I was ready to pay
Now you say I'm only holding you down
Like some old rock you've been dragging around
Yes, I'm your rock but I'm rolling away

I'm rolling away on a downhill grade
But I'm coming to rest side
A mountain of love some day
'Cause I finally understand
If you're resting on shifting sands
Even a rock goes rolling away

And I was your rock standing strong for you
There was nothing I wouldn't do
No matter the cost I was ready to pay
Oh now you say I'm only holding you down
Like some old rock you've been dragging around
Yes, I'm your rock and I'm rolling away

"
"The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
The sky is crying,
Can you see the tears roll down the street.
I've been looking for my baby
And I've been wondering where can she be

I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more
You know the sky's been crying
Can see you see the tears roll down my door"
"The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a queen
But foolish though it may seem to me that's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You never know how slow the moments go
Oh until I'm near here to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in the stars above
Its just the thought of you
The very thought of you my love

It's just the thought of you babe 
The very thought of you my love"

"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you"
"There's something on your mind
By the way you look at me
There is something on your mind, baby
By the way you look at me
And what you're thinking brings happiness
Oh, and it bring misery

Please, please, don't try to tell me
I think, I, I understand
No, no, don't try to tell me, baby
'Cause I think, I, I understand
You want me to try and forget you
Well, I'll do, baby, I'll do the best I can

You know it hurts you when you're in love with someone
And you know that someone don't love you
It carries a heavy burden on your heart to know
That the someone that you're in love with
Is in love with your best friend

And I'll tell you, when someone else is rocking you
Rocking your cradle, you know, better
Than you can rock your cradle yourself
Then there's only one thing for you to do

You just pack your clothes turn around
And slowly walk out of the door
Look over your left shoulder as you go out
Then you hang your head and you say

Oh please don't try to tell me
Uh huh, I think, I understand
No, no, no, no please don't try to tell me
Because you think, you think I understand
Oh you want me to try, to try to forget you, baby
And I'll tell you, I'll do the best I can

You know after you have done all you could do
And you can't take no more, then you go downtown
You get your big baseball bat
And you come back on the scene

Where they both are still together
And then you just go and kick down the door
Now as you kick down the door you just start
Beating the hell of everybody that you can see

Everybody that comes through the door
And just as you make up your mind that you're gonna try
To forgive her, then out comes another one of your friends

And that really blows your mind so you go and think about
You say to yourself, baby I realize I've done wrong
But please forgive me and with a smirky smile on her face
Then she look up at you and she say

If you ever think about me
(Oh I think about you, baby)
If you ever change your mind
(Oh you're staying on my mind, baby)

If you ever think about me
(Oh I think, I think about you all the time)
And if I ever cross your mind
(You stay on my mind)

Well, you know, you know
You know I'm yours
And I know, I know you got to be mine
(Yeah)

There's something on your mind, be
I can tell by the way you look at me
(Oh, there's something, on my mind, baby)
There is something on your mind
(Oh can you tell, there's something on my mind)
By the way you look at me
(Oh the way I look at you, you look good to me)

And what you're thinking brings happiness
(Yes, baby)
Oh and it can bring misery
(Yes, all right)"
"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you"

I know
(I know)
That you know
(You know)
That I am
(I am)
In love with you

We know, we know, we know
That they know, they know, they know
That we are, we are, we are so in love

You know, you know, you know
I know, I know, I know
You, you, you, a love me too

It is no secret what two hearts can do
A baby, won't you give me just a one more chance
To prove my love to you?

I know
(I know)
That you know
(You know)
That I am
(I am, I am)
In love with you

I know, I know, I know
You know, you know, you know
They know, they know, they know
We know, we know, we know that we're in love"
"Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you
You're in love
Your heart's fluttering all day long
You only stutter cause your poor tongue
Just will not utter the words
'I love you'
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
When a little moonbeam comes peepin' through
You'll get bored
You can't resist her
And all you'll say
When you have kissed her is
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do

If by chance you have a bashful sweetheart
Moonlight will teach him to care
and the greatest lover will discover
That he's got time for just one more affair

You'll get bored
You can't resist her
And all you'll say
When you have kissed her is
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do"
"Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, yea

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on
What's going on
Ya, what's going on
Ah, what's going on

In the mean time
Right on, baby
Right on
Right on

Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today
Oh

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me
So you can see
What's going on
Ya, what's going on
Tell me what's going on
I'll tell you what's going on - Uh
Right on baby
Right on baby"
"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

And may all your Christmases be white (all your Christmases be white)
And may all your Christmases be white (all your Christmases be white)
And may all your Christmases be
(All your Christmases be white)
(All your Christmases be white)"
"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you"
"Oh, oh, oh yeah, oh

Talking about you, a man
Always ready to go
When it come to movin' daddy
Baby, you're almost gold
Oh, oh, oh

I'm a W.O.M.A.N.
A woman
A woman

You ain't got nothin' in your pocket
To keep no girl alive
But she got somethin' for all you men
Somethin' to make you cry
Ha, ow, ow, ow

I'm a W.O.M.A.N.
A woman, yeah
A woman

Now Davy Crockett
He was the king of the wild frontier
I'd take him down
If he had his old dead self here

Now Jesse James and Frank James
Baddest men in the land
We got some women, who'd make 'em eat now
Out of your hand

Now John Dillinger
The woman in red got him
Now teach all you hardies about a W.O.M.A.N.

Ow, ow, ow

I'm a W O M one A and a N
A woman
A woman

I'm a woman child
And I ain't lyin'
For sure I'm a woman, yeah
And I ain't hardly died yet

Woman
One little rib tickle
From the side of bed, yeah, yeah
They call us woman

Oh, yeah
Oh, oh yeah

"
"If you read in the paper that I went away
Would it make any difference to you?
If I packed my things and left town today
Would it make any difference to you?

Do you, do you even know?
Do you even know that I'm still alive?

Oh, I wonder
I wonder if I ever, oh, cross
If I ever cross your sweet mind

If I got in, if I got into trouble
Would I send for you?
Would you come, would you come
Or would you stay away?

If we never love again
Like we used to do
Would it make, oh
Would it make any difference to you?"
"Baby, take off your coat...(real slow)
Baby, take off your shoes...(here, I'll take your shoes)
Baby, take off your dress
Yes, yes, yes

You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
Go on over there and turn on the light...no, all the lights

Now come back here and stand on this chair...that's right
Raise your arms up in to the air...shake 'em
You give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live
You give me a reason to live

Suspicious minds are talking
Trying to tear us apart
They say that my love is wrong

They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
I know what love is"
"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose,
You don't know what love is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is."
"Ow! 

You give me what I want, when I want it, uh-huh
And I give you what you need when you need it, baby, uh-huh, yeah yeah

"Well you're making a big mistake, girl 
Trying to hold back your love from me 
'Cause there's nothin' I can't do for you 
Sure got the love that you need 

Everything, anything, in the world 
If I can be your man 
I would beg, borrow, 
I would steal for you, honey 
As long as you understand 

You don't have to worry 
What more can say 
To make you understand 
Oooh, that I don't give a damn who knows it 
You are the one, the one I truly need 
Baby won't you listen to me 

You got it, any way you want it 
Any way you want it to be 
You can have it, take it from me 
'Cause it's waiting for you 

Now if something is on your mind, girl 
Got to let me know right away 
I will try my best to smooth it over 
Nothing's going to stand in the way 
Anywhere, anytime, day or night 
Don't make no difference to me 

I will come running, way across town 
As long as I know that you need 
What I have to give 
All that I can to make you feel all right 
You got it, anyway you want it 
Any way you want it to be 
You can have it, take it from me 
'Cause it's waiting for you
"
"You've got me where you want me
And I hope you're satisfied
You've got me where you want me
And you hardly even tried
One single look was all I took
And then, starry-eyed
I watched my poor old heart
Go on that roller-coaster ride
I say I won't surrender
But I know darn well I will
My hopes are pretty slender
And my chances almost nil
Why should I try to alibi
Anyone can see
You've got me where you want me
And it's where I wanna be

You've got me where you want me
And I hope you're satisfied
You've got me where you want me
And you never even tried
A single look was all it took
And then, starry-eyed
I watched my poor heart
Go on that roller-coaster ride
I say I won't surrender
But I know darn well you will
My hopes are pretty slender
And my chances almost nil
Why should I try to alibi
When anyone can see
You've got me where you want me
You've got me where you want me
And it's where I wanna be
And it's where I wanna be
And it's where I wanna be"
"You know you shook me
You shook me all night long
You know you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
You shook me so hard baby
Baby, baby, please come home

I have a bird that whistles
And I have birds that sing
I have a bird that whistles
And I have birds that sing
I have a baby, won't do nothing oh!
Oh, oh, buy a diamond ring

You know you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
I know you really, really, did baby
I said you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
You shook me so hard, baby
You shook me all night long"
"You're gonna make me cry
You're gonna make me cry, baby
Oh baby, hey, don't make me cry

You're gonna break my heart
You're gonna break my heart
Well, well, well, well, baby
Don't break my heart

You know, love can bring happiness, baby
Love can bring sorrow, love can be here today, baby
You know what? Love can be gone tomorrow
Oh my baby, don't make me cry

You're gonna make me cry
You're gonna make me cry
Hey, baby, don't make me cry

Love is something that is hard to figure out
But love is something that the whole world wanna know about
Oh, baby, oh, baby, don't break my heart
But if you insist you're gonna doin' it, this is what I'm gonna do, babe

I'm gonna leave you alone
I'm gonna leave you alone
Hey, baby, don't break my heart

You're gonna make me cry
You're gonna make me cry
Oh, don't make me cry

You're gonna make me cry, yeah, baby
You're gonna make me cry
Hey, baby, don't make me cry

"
"You've changed
The sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed

You've changed
Your kisses are so blase
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed

You've forgotten the words, 'I love you'
Each memory that we've shared
You've ignored every star up above you
I can't realize you ever cared

Oh, you've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
Oh, no need to tell me that we're through, babe
It is all over now
You've changed

Oh baby, you've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
Oh, no need to tell me that we're through, babe
It is all over now
You've changed

Oh said, “You've changed, yeah”
Said, “It's, it's all over now”
Oh yeah, you've changed
Oh, you've changed
Oh, you've changed, you've changed

"
"I don't have to beg you to hold me
Cause somebody else will
You don't have to love me when I want it, no
Cause somebody else will

Your so called friends say you don't need it
When all the time they're trying to get it
Look out
Your good thing is about to come to an end
Your real good thing is about to come to an end

All those nites I watched the four walls
I did not have to watch them all alone
When other men said they wanted me (whenever someone said)
I didn't have to tell them I was your very own (think that I was)

You have all the love that I've got baby
Even ice melts to water and gets hot
Look out
Your good

Gettin' myself back together
Is going to be a big problem I know
But when the right man says he wants me
You can bet I won't tell him no

Cause your real good"
