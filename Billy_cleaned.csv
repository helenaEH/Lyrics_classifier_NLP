"They say it takes a lot to keep a love alive:
In every heart there pumps a different beat

But if we shift the rhythm into overdrive,
We could generate a lot of heat....

CHORUS
On 52nd Street
On 52nd Street

We're gonna throw a little soul parade,
Before they know the second bar was played

We're gonna slip it to 'em short and sweet

CHORUS

"It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel OK

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight

It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright, ow

So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel OK

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight

It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright"
"One, two, one, two, three, four

Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will it's just a question of when
I've lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned
But that won't happen to us
Cause it's always been a matter of trust

I know you're an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
I can't offer you proof
But you're going to face a moment of truth
It's hard when you're always afraid
You just recover when another belief is betrayed
So break my heart if you must
It's a matter of trust

You can't go the distance
With too much resistance
I know you have doubts
But for god's sake don't shut me out

This time you've got nothing to lose
You can take it, you can leave it, whatever you choose
I won't hold back anything
And I'll walk away a fool or a king
Some love is just a lie of the mind
It's make believe until its only a matter of time
And some might have learned to adjust
But then it never was a matter of trust

I'm sure you're aware love
We've both had our share of believing too long
When the whole situation was wrong

Some love is just a lie of the soul
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control
After you've heard lie upon lie
There can hardly be a question of why
Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start

But that can't happen to us
Cause it's always been a matter of trust
It's a matter of trust
It's always been a matter of trust
It's a matter of trust
Cause it's always been a matter of trust"
"Some days I have to give right in to the blues
Despite how I try to keep fightin'
It's a sure shot I'm going to lose
And I'll tell you why
You think I'm crazy
It's such a sad composition
But can you blame me
For what's been causing my bad disposition?
Ain't nothing new with my blue situation
And nothing's fine, it's just a minor variation

When troubles want to find me, I ain't hard to find
They know where I am
Like a hungry pack of wolves when it's feeding time
They tear up a man
And it's a strange thing
""Cause now it don't really matter
More of the same thing
Don't even hurt it's been part of the pattern
But still in all it's a small consulation
I just define it as a minor variation

Ain't now way to fight 'em darling
Ain't no way around 'em baby
Ain't now way to take 'em honey
Nowhere to hide and believe me I've tried to shake 'em

I'm getting to the point where I don't feel the pain
And I've had enough
I'm ready for the next time it hits me again
""Cause I've gotten tough
It doesn't faze me
And now I've made my decision
I may be crazy
It's not as though I don't know that condition
Until I'm through with this blue situation
Pass me the wine, it's just a minor variation

Ain't nobody's business, baby
Ain't nobody's worry darlin'
Ain't nobody's problem
No way to win when you've already been forgotten

And it's a strange thing
""Cause now it don't really matter
More of the same thing
Don't even hurt, it's a part of the pattern
Until I'm through with this blue situation
Pass me the wine, it's just a minor variation

"You've got diamonds and I've got spades
You've got pills
And I've got razor blades
You've got yoga honey
I've got beer
You got overpriced
And I got weird
But it's alright
We're the same even though we're alone
It's alright
Yes we all need a room of our own
You've got love darlin'
I've got sex
You've got cash, mama
And I've got checks
You've got business, baby
I've got the kids
You got crowded just the way I did
But it's alright
Cause we all need a place to call home
It's alright
Yes we all need a room of our own
I can still remember packed together
Like a can of sardines
No, no, no
Pushin', shovin'
That's when lovin'
Starts to come apart at the seams
Oh no, no, no, no
You've got the day shift
I've got nights
We go wrong at times
But we've got rights
You've got TV shows
I've got crime
But you've got your room, honey
And I've got mine
It's alright
It's the one thing that we should have known
Yes, it's alright
Yes, we all need a room of our own
And it's alright
Yes we all need a place to call home
It's alright
Yes we all need a room of our own
It's alright
It's alright
To have a room of your own
No, no, no, it's alright
Yeah it's alright mama
To have a room of our own
Sometimes you've got to get away
Got to get away
Got to get away
Got to get away to a room of our own
Got to have a room
Got to have a little elbow room of my own.

"You got to open your eyes in the morning
Nine o'clock comin' with out any warnin'
And you gotta get ready to go
You say you went out late last evenin'
Did a lot of drinkin'
Come home stinkin'
And you went and fell asleep on the floor
And then your lady comes and finds you asleepin'
Starts in to weepin' 'bout the hours you been keepin'
And you better get your ass out the door 

Ain't no crime
Say everybody gets that way some time
Ain't no crime
You know it's good to get it on to get a load off your mind
Oh no, it ain't no crime. Oh. 

You got to open your eyes in the morning
Nine o'clock comin' with out any warnin' 
And you gotta get ready to go
Well now you tell me you love somebody 
And you'll love 'em forever
You may love 'em forever
But you won't like 'em all of the time
Well now you tell me you need somebody for the rest of your life
You might have somebody
But you won't want 'em everyday 

Ain't no crime
Say ev'rybody gets that way some time
Ain't no crime
Well it's just human nature
Happens all the time
Oh no, it ain't no crime. Oh 

And just as surely as the wind keeps blowin'
The grass keeps growin'
You gotta keep goin'
And the Lord have mercy on your soul
La, la la la."
"She waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence 
She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain 
And so far she hasn't run, though I swear she's had her moments 
She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain

It's all about soul 
It's all about faith and a deeper devotion 
It's all about soul 
'Cause under the love is a stronger emotion 
She's got to be strong 
'Cause so many things getting out of control 
Should drive her away 
So why does she stay?
It's all about soul

She turns to me sometimes and asks me what I'm dreaming 
And I realize I must have gone a million miles away 
And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me that moment
And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say

It's all about soul
It's all about knowing what someone is feeling 
The woman's got soul 
The power of love and the power of healing 
This life isn't fair 
It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold 
You've got to be tough, but that ain't enough 
It's all about soul

There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness 
There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive
She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires
And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive

It's all about soul 
It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow 
It's all about soul 
Who's standing now and who's standing tomorrow 
You've got to be hard 
Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n' roll 
But that's only part, you know in your heart 
It's all about soul"

"All my life, I've searched this whole world through
Try as I might, to find someone like you
The years drifted by, but it was always on my mind
I didn't know how long I'd go, until I ran out of time 

All my life, I've hurt the ones who cared
One by one, no loving heart was spared
I've been a wild and restless man, but still a man who needs a wife
That was my dream and now it seems you've taken all my life

For as long as I could my intentions were good
I assumed my affairs would be fine
But I know very well, there's a long road to hell
That's been paved with intentions like mine

All my life, I've paid for my mistakes
After a while, the strongest spirit breaks
I've had heartache and pain, it cut me deeper than a knife
But those days are done, 'cause you're the one I've wanted all my life 

And I know very well, there's a long road to hell
That's been paved with intentions like mine
All my life, my stars were surely crossed 
Now and then, I missed the love I lost
But all that changed, the day you said you'd be my wife 

Who could have known that finding you 
Would only take me all my life"
"Well, bless my soul, what's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' queer as a bug
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah

Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Now who do you think of when you have such luck
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah

Well, please don't ask what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up but I'm feeling fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so that it scares me to death

Well, she touched my hand what a chill I got
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah

Well, my tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this soul of mine
That's to have that girl that I love so fine

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her kisses are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah
Uh huh huh, oh, hey, yeah, yeah, I'm all shook up!"
"Oh baby, you don't get turned on by the radio.
Oh baby, you got nothing to play on your stereo.
""Why don't the Beatles get back together?""
""Why don't nobody sing of romance?""-
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance.

Oh baby, I think you are lost in the seventies.
Oh baby, ""The music she ain't what she used to be.""
You don't understand what they're saying,
You've given it every chance
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance.

Well you wish you were back in the good old days,
When tomatoes were cheaper,
And you never heard the words of your favorite songs
Through a three inch speaker.
And you never messed around with dangerous drugs,
You were all getting sick on beer-
And you didn't get any (unless you went steady and made out for a year).

Well you can hide away honey, in your rock and roll dreams,
You can stand by your blue suede shoes-
But the party is over,
And I'm getting tired of waiting for you.

Oh baby, ""Where are the oldies they used to play?""
Oh baby, you want to crawl back into yesterday,
You don't want to deal with the future,
You don't want to make any plans-
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance.
"
"She stood on the tracks
Waving her arms
Leading me to that third rail, SHOCK
Quick as a wink
She changed her mind

She gave me a night
That?s all it was
What will it take until I STOP
Kidding myself, wasting my time, whoa

There?s nothing else I can do
?Cause I?m doing it All For Leyna
I don?t want anyone new
?Cause I?m living it All For Leyna
There?s nothing in it for you
?Cause I?m giving it all to Leyna

We laid on the beach
Watching the tide
She didn?t tell me there were, ROCKS
Under the waves
Right off the shore

Washed up on the sand
Barely alive
Wishing the undertow would, STOP
How can a man take anymore, whoa

There?s nothing else I can do
?Cause I?m doing it All For Leyna
I don?t want anyone new
?Cause I?m living it All For Leyna
There?s nothing in it for you
?Cause I?m giving it all to Leyna

I?m failing in school
Loosing my friends
Making my family loose their minds
I don?t want to eat
I don?t want to sleep
I only want Leyna, one more time

Now, I?m in my room
Watching the tube
Telling myself, she still may, DROP
Over to say, she?s changed her mind

So, I wait in the dark
Listening for her
Instead of hearing my old man saying, STOP
Kidding yourself, wasting your time

There?s nothing else I can do
?Cause I?m doing it All For Leyna
I don?t want anyone new
?Cause I?m living it All For Leyna
There?s nothing in it for you
?Cause I?m giving it all to Leyna

"Well we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line
Well our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers in the USO
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow
And we're living here in Allentown

But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay

Well we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard
If we behaved

So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coal
And chromium steel
And we're waiting here in Allentown

But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away

Every child has a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our place

Well I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be giving up today

And we're living here in Allentown"

"She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child, but she's always a woman to me

She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth, but she'll never believe
And she'll take what you give her, as long it's free
Yeah, She steals like a thief, but she's always a woman to me

Ohhh...she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants, she's ahead of her time
Ohhh...and she never gives out
And she never gives in, she just changes her mind

And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding
But she'll bring out the best and the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a woman to me

Ohhh...she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants, she's ahead of her time
Ohhh...and she never gives out
And she never gives in, she just changes her mind

She's frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool

But she's always a woman to me"

I know you're thinking of somebody else

Making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can

Because I am an innocent man
I am an innocent man

Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well

Than to wait anymore

I know you don't want to hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there and if I can survive
I can keep you alive

"In every heart there is a room 
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense 
And still I feel I said too much 
My silence is my self defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows"
"There's a place in the world  for the angry young man 
With his working class ties and his radical plans 
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl 
And he's always at home with his back to the wall. 
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost 
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 

Give a moment or two to the angry young man 
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand 
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood 
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good 
He sits in a room with a lock on the door 
With his maps and his medals laid out of the floor 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man. 

I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage, 
I've found that just surviving was a noble fight 
I once believed in causes too, had my pointless point of view 
Life went on no matter who was right or wrong. 

And there's always a place for the angry young man 
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand 
He's never been able to learn from mistakes 
He can't understand why his heart always breaks 
His honor is pure, and his courage as well 
He's fair and he's true, and he's boring as hell 
And he'll go to his grave as an angry old man. 

There's a place in the world  for the angry young man 
With his working class ties and his radical plans

"Late at night
When it's dark and cold
I reach out
For someone to hold
When I'm blue
When I'm lonely
She comes through
She's the only one who can
My baby grand
Is all I need

In my time
I've wandered everywhere
Around this world
She would always be there
Any day
Any hour
All it takes
Is the power in my hands
This baby grand's
Been good to me

I've had friends
But they have slipped away
I've had fame
But it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes
Spent them fast enough
As for woman
They don't last with just one man
But baby grand
Will stand by me

They say that no one's gonna play this on the radio
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone
But only songs like these
Played in minor keys
Keep those memories holding on

I've come far
From the life I've strayed in
I've got scars
From those dives I've played in
Now I'm home
And I'm weary
In my bones
Every dreary one night stand
But baby grand
Came home with me

Ever since this gig began
My baby grand's
Been good to me"
"Oh, flew in from Miami Beach B.O.A.C.
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R. (Yeah)

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.
Back in the U.S.
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind

Aw come on!
Ho yeah!
Ho yeah!
Ho ho yeah!
Yeah yeah!

Yeah I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind

Oh, show me around your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
Hey you don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Oh let me tell you, honey
Hey, I'm back!
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
Yes, I'm free!
Yeah, back in the U.S.S.R.

"From a town known as Wheeling, West Virginia 
Rode a boy with a six gun in his hand 
And his daring life of crime 
made him a legend in his time 
east and west of the Rio Grande. 

Well he started with a bank in Colorado 
in the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid 
and his age and his size 
took the teller by surprise 
and, the word spread of Billy the kid 

Well he never travelled heavy 
yes he always rode alone 
and he soon put many older guns to shame 
and he never had a sweetheart 
and he never had a home 
but the cowboy and the rancher knew his name 

Well he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma 
and the largest could not seem to track him down 
and it served his legend well 
For the folks they loved to tell about 
When Billy the kid came to town

Well one cold day a posse captured Billy 
and the judge said ""String him up for what he did"" 
And the cowboys and their kin 
like the sea, came pouring in 
to watch the hanging of Billy the kid.

Well he never travelled heavy 
yes he always rode alone 
and he soon put many older guns to shame 
and he never had a sweetheart 
but he finally found a home 
under the boothill grave that bears his name.

"Why can't I lay low
Why can't I say what I mean
Why don't I stay home
And get myself into some boring routine

Why can't I calm down
Why is it always a fight
I can't get unwound
Why do I throw myself into the night

I'm on the outside
I don't fit into the groove
Now I ain't a bad guy
So tell me what am I trying to prove

Why can't I cool out
Why don't I button my lip
Why do I lash out
Why is it I always shoot from the hip

I cruise from Houston to canal street
A misfit and a rebel
I see the winds talking to themselves
And I can understand
Why is it everytime I go out
I always seem to get in trouble
I guess I made an impression on somebody
North of Hester and south of grand

And so in my small way
I'm a big man on Mulberry street
I don't mean all day
Only at night when I'm light on my feet

What else have I got
That I'd be trying to hide
Maybe a blind spot
I haven't seen from the sensitive side

But you know in my own heart
I'm a big man on Mulberry street
I play the whole part
I leave a big tip with every receipt

I'm so romantic
I'm such a passionate man
Sometimes I panic
What if nobody finds out who I am"
"Well, you went uptown riding in your limousine
With your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand
And the spoon up your nose
And when you wake up in the morning
With your head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitchin' to me

Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You know what everything's about
You and to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night

They were all impressed with your Halston dress
And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And the story of your latest success
Kept 'em so entertained
Oh, but now you just don't remember
All the things you said
And you're not sure you want to know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show

Yes, yes, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to prove it to the crowd
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
So much fun to be around
You had to have the front page, bold type
You had to be a big shot last night

Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone
But you went over the line
You couldn't see it was time to go home
No, no, no, no, no, no, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
So much fun to be around
You had to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night

Big shot
Big shot
Big shot
Big shot
Big shot
Big shot"

"Some days when I'm far away
In a lonely room in a cold seclusion
Some nights when I'm wound so tight
There is no release, there is no solution
In hell there's a big hotel
Where the bar just closed and the windows never opened
No phone so you can't call home
And the TV works, but the clicker is broken
But in the darkness I see your light turned on
You know my weakness, you know how I respond to

CHORUS
Blonde over blue
Your hands are cold, your eyes are fire
Blonde over blue
They shine as though you're burning inside
One word from you is all I need to be inspired
Blonde over blue
I need your inspiration tonight

These days there's a million ways
To be pulled and torn, to be misdirected
These times there are sins and crimes
On the morning shows for the disconnected
I look and I write my book
And I walk away with the wrong impressions
I don't care 'cause I've done my share
And I need some time for my own obsessions
It doesn't matter, I've let that life go by
It's been forgotten 'cause all I wanted was you

CHORUS

These days not a damn soul prays
ANd there is no faith 'cause there's nothing to believe in
THese days only good luck pays
If we don't get paid then we try to get even
I look and I write my book
And I have my say and I draw conclusions
Some nights when I'm wound so tight
There is no release, there is no solution
But in the darkness I see your light turned on
You know my weakness, you know how I respond to

CHORUS

"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream 
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines 
Sprung from cages out on highway nine, 
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back 
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we're young 
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run 

Yes, girl we were

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend 
I want to guard your dreams and visions 
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
And strap your hands 'cross my engines 
Together we could break this trap 
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire 
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
But I gotta know how it feels 
I want to know if love is wild 
Babe I want to know if love is real 

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard 
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
And the boys try to look so hard 
The amusement park rises bold and stark 
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist 
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight 
In an everlasting kiss 

One, two, three, four!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive 
Everybody's out on the run tonight 
But there's no place left to hide 
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness 
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul 
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when 
We're gonna get to that place 
Where we really wanna go 
And we'll walk in the sun 
But till then tramps like us 
Baby we were born to run 

Oh honey, tramps like us
Baby we were born to run 

Come on with me, tramps like us"
"Here I am again
In this smoky place
With my brandy eyes
I'm talking to myself
You were the one
You were the one

Here I go again
Looking for your face
And I realize
That I should look for someone else
But you were the one
You were the one

I'm looking for comfort
That I can take
From someone else
But after all
I know there is no one
That can save me from myself
You were the only one

Me revoici
Dans ce bar enfume
Avec mes yeux iures
Je me parle a moi meme
See'etait toi
See'etait toi

Me revoici
Cherchant ton visage
Et je realise
Que je devrais en chercher une autre
See'etait toi
You were the one

Je recherche l'affection
Qu'une autre pourrait me donner
Mais apres tout
Je sais qu'il n'why a personne
Personne qui puisse me sauver
Tu etais la seule

I'm looking for comfort
That I can take
From someone else
But after all
I know there is no one
That can save me, save me from myself
You were the only one"
"Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty second row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

The candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did"
"Saturday night and you're still hangin' around
Tired of living in your one horse town
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground
For awhile

So you go to the village in your tie dyed jeans
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It's like some pornographic magazine
And you smile

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'

Oh yeah

Your sister's gone out, she's on a date
You just sit at home and masturbate
Your phone is gonna ring soon,
But you just can't wait
For that call

So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes
Ah but still your fingers gonna pick your nose
After all

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'

So you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway
What for

So you got everything, ah, but nothing's cool
They just found your father in the swimming pool
And you guess you won't be going back to school
Anymore

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'

So you play your albums, and you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot
Oh but still you're aching for the things you haven't got
What went wrong

And if you can't understand why your world is so dead
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head
Well you're 21 and still your mother makes your bed
And that's too long

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'

"Careless talk
That's what you heard about me
Jealous talk
That's what I heard about you
Everybody's telling lies
I don't even know why
Why can't people
Find something better to do

Careless talk
I don't believe what they say
I heard them talk
They say you've been putting me down
In the shadows on the phone
They won't leave us alone
They've been talking
Ever since you came around

Careless talk
Telling you I'm doing wrong
Jealous talk
Follows wherever you go

I'm aware of what you heard
Every terrible word
Everybody's making believe that they know
All of the intimate things
That we ever might have said

In the heat of a passionate moment
In a conversation shared
For the ears of nobody else
There are some things they will never hear
There are secrets I'll never tell

Careless talk
Going around on the streets
Jealous talk
I know how bad it can be

Let them stand where they fall
They don't know us at all
All that talking won't make a difference to me


"
"Let me tell you a story
About a woman and a man
Maybe you will find familiar
Maybe you won't understand

The man's name I don't remember
He was always Joe to me
But I can't forget the woman
She was always Christie Lee

He was working in a night club
That's where he played the saxophone
He used to fake to stock arrangements
He left the customers alone

But one night before the last song
About a quarter after three
He saw her standing at the coat check
And made his move on Christie Lee

Christie Lee, Christie Lee
Christie Lee, Christie Lee

She was a nice piece of music
She had a rhythm all her own
He blew a solo like a blind man
She really dug his saxophone

She wanted more than just an encore
And he could play in every key
He left the stage and packed his alto
And he took it home with Christie Lee

Oh I heard the man knew ""the Bird"" like the bible
You know the man could blow an educated axe
He couldn't see that Christie Lee was a woman
Who didn't need another lover
All she wanted was the sax

It took a while for him to notice
It took a while for him to see
He was never in control here
It was always Christie Lee

Christie Lee, Christie Lee
Christie Lee, Christie Lee

Oh the man took a calculated gamble
Yes the man had the power to perform
But Christie Lee was more than he knew how to handle
She didn't need him as a man
All she wanted was the horn

They say that Joe became a wino
They say he always drinks alone
They say he stumbles like a blind man
They say he sold his saxophone

Even the band must face the music
That's what the moral is to me
The only time you hit the high note
Is when you play for Christie Lee

Christie Lee, Christie Lee
Christie Lee, Christie Lee

"Blackout, heatwave, .44 caliber homicide
The bums drop dead and dogs gone mad
In packs on the West Side
Young girl standing on a ledge looks like another suicide
She wants to hit those bricks
Cause the news at six gotta stick to a deadline
While the millionaires hide in Beekman Place
The bag ladies throw their bones in my face
I get attacked by a kid with stereo sound
I don't want to hear it but he won't turn it down
Life is tough but it's just enough
To hold back the tears until it's closing time
I survived, I'm still alive
But I'm getting close to the borderline
Close to the borderline

A buck three eighty
Won't buy you much lately on the street these days
And when you can get gas
You know you can't drive fast anymore on the parkways
Rich man, poor man, either way American
Shoved into the lost and found
The no nuke yell we're gonna all go to hell
With the next big meltdown
I got remote control and a color T.V.
I don't change channels so they must change me
I got real close friends that will get me high
They don't know how to talk and they ain't gonna try
I shouldn't bitch, I shouldn't cry
I'd start a revolution but I don't have time
I don't know why I'm still a nice guy
But I'm getting close to the borderline
Close to the borderline

I thought I'd sacrifice so many things
I thought I'd throw them all away
I didn't think I needed anything
But you can't afford to squander what you're not prepared to pay

I need a doctor for my pressure pills
I need a lawyer for my medical bills
I need a banker to finance my home
But I need security to back my loan
It isn't new what I'm going through
But everybody knows you got to break sometime
Another night I fought the good fight
But I'm getting closer to the borderline
Closer to the borderline"
"Everybody's got a million questions
Everybody wants to know the score
What you went through
It's something you
Should be over now

Everybody wants to hear the secrets
That you never told a soul before
And it's not that strange
Because it wouldn't change
What happened anyhow

But you swore to yourself a long time ago
There were some things that people never needed to know
Guess there's one that you keep
That you bury so deep
No one can tear it out

And you can't talk about it
Because you're following a code of silence
You're never gonna to lose the anger
You just deal with it a different way

And you can't talk about it
And isn't that a kind of madness
To be living by a code of silence
When you've really got a lot to say

You don't want to lose a friendship
There's nothing that you have to hide
And a little dirt
Couldn't hurt no one anyway

And you still have a rage inside you
That you carry with a certain pride
In the only part of the broken heart
That you could ever save

But you've been through it once
You know how it ends
You don't see the point
Of going through it again
And this ain't the place
And this ain't the time
And neither's any other day

So you can't talk about it
Because you're following a code of silence
You're never gonna to lose the anger
You just deal with it a different way

So you can't talk about it
And isn't that a kind of madness
To be living by a code of silence
When you've really got a lot to say

I know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons
That's not the kind of code you're inclined to break
Some things unknown are best left alone forever
And if a vow is what it takes
Haven't you paid for your mistakes

After the moment passes
And the impulse disappears
You can still hold back
Because you don't crack very easily

It's a time honored resolution
Because the danger is always near
It's with you now
But that ain't how it was supposed to be

And it's hard to believe after all these years
That it still gives you pain and it still brings tears
And you feel like a fool
Because it's part of your rules
You've got a memory

But you can't talk about it
Because you're following a code of silence
You're never gonna to lose the anger
You just deal with it a different way

But you can't talk about it
And isn't that a kind of madness
To be living by a code of silence
When you've really got a lot to say"
"Dance To The Music
All we need is a drummer for people who only need a beat. Yeah
I'm gonna add a little guitar and make it easy to move your feet
I'm gonna add some bottom so that the dancers will twist all night
You might like to hear my organ I said my kind of bag now.
If I could hear the horns blow sitting here on the ground listen to me
Dance To The Music
Dance To The Music"
"All the waiters in your grand cafe
Leave their tables when you blink
Every dog must have his everyday
Every drunk must have his drink
Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why

All your life you had to stand in line
Still you're standing on your feet
All your choices made you change your mind
Now your calendar's complete
Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why

You can say the human heart is only make believe
And I am only fighting fire with fire
But you are still a victim
Of the accidents you leave
As sure as I'm a victim of desire

All the servants in your new hotel
Throw their roses at your feet
Fool them all but baby I can tell
You're no stranger to the street
Don't ask for favors
Don't talk to strangers
Don't ask me why

Yesterday you were an only child
Now your ghosts have gone away
You can kill them in the classic style
Now you, ""parlez vous francais""
Don't look for answers
You took your chances
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why"
"i can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when i met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Ladies and gentlemen Mr. Elton John
I can't find
Oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way feel
Don't discard me baby don't
Just because you think i mean you harm
Just because you think i mean you harm, oh
But these cuts i have, cuts i have
They need love
They need love, they need love to help them heal

Oh, don't let the sun go down on me
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
Cause' losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although i search myself, it's always someone else i that see, yeah
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby, oh
Cause' losing everything is like the sun going down on me"
"Well, it's been building up inside of me for, oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why but I keep thinking something's bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes and makes me realize and she says

(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out all right
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby) Ooh ooh

I guess I should've kept my mouth shut when I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive and makes me wanna drive when she says

(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out all right
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)

She told me, baby when you race today, just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you, baby, nothing could go wrong with you
Oh, what she does to me when she makes love to me and she says...

(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out all right
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out all right
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out all right
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out all right
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out all right
(Don't worry, baby) Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)"
"Well I'm on the Downeaster ""Alexa""
And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound
I have charted a course to the Vineyard
But tonight I am Nantucket bound

We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday
And left this morning from the bell in Gardiner's Bay
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
Too proud to leave I worked my fingers to the bone

So I could own my Downeaster ""Alexa""
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep

I've got bills to pay and children who need clothes
I know there's fish out there but where God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I've got people back on land who count on me

So if you see my Downeaster ""Alexa""
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trawling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel

Now I drive my Downeaster ""Alexa""
More and more miles from shore every year
Since they tell me I can't sell no stripers
And there's no luck in swordfishing here.

I was a bayman like my father was before
Can't make a living as a bayman anymore
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea
But there ain't no island left for islanders like me"
"You don't have to talk all night
I'm a man who can't say no
You don't have to twist my arm
Just point me where you want to go

Take me to the action
Take me to the track
Take me to a party if they're bettin' in the back
I've been working all my life
Can't afford to wait
Let me call my wife so I can tell her I'll be late

I want the easy
Easy money
Easy money
I could get lucky
Oh, things could go right

I want the easy
Easy money
Easy money
Maybe this one time
Maybe tonight

You don't have to try too hard
I don't need a song and dance
I don't need an invitation
If you've got a game of chance

Take me to the tables
Take me to the fights
Run me like the numbers
Roll me like the dice

When you're counting on a killing
Always count me in
Talk me into losin' just as long as I can win

I want the easy
Easy money
Easy money
I want the good times
Oh, I never had

I want the easy
Easy money
I want the good life
I want it bad

Easy money
You say I fool myself
But better me than being a fool for someone else
I got a hot slot machine of a system
Ready to go

Easy money
I got a one-track mind
And a good reputation laying on the line
I'll either come back a bum or a king
Baby I don't know

You don't have to start a fight
I'm a man who can't say no
If you've got a little risky business
Just point me where you want to go

Take me to the power
Take me to the heat
Take me to the cleaners
If it's open to the street

Something's got to pay off
Something's got to break
Someone's got a fortune that they're begging
Me to take

I want the easy
Easy money
Easy money
I could get lucky
Things could go right

I want the easy
Easy money
Easy money
Maybe just this time
Oh maybe tonight

Easy money
Oh I don't want no hard cash
I just want the easy money
I could get lucky

"Once long ago, all the faithful held a show
Down in Elvis Presley Blvd. on Memphis Radio
Where the hopeless held a vigil and the nameless played the charts
Where the losers lost their sorrow and the lonely left their hearts

Step on these shoes then I'll see you in hell
""Love me so tender,"" I cried
Save me a room in the Heartbreak Hotel
I'm so alone, I could die

I took a ride with my baby by my side
And the Elvis Presley Blvd. where all the faithful cried
And I saw that silent mansion and I knew that I was lost
They were selling plastic souvenirs of Elvis on the cross

Step on these shoes and I'll see you in hell
""Love me so tender,"" I cried
Save me a room in the Heartbreak Hotel
I'm so alone, I could die

Drive down that road tonight, everyone is gone
Nobody's home but the light's always on

Man I was beat, I was driven by the heat
Down to Elvis Presley Blvd. in a one-way dead end street
And I smashed my car to pieces and I said goodbye to youth
I had all the ugly rumors and I could not face the truth

Save me a room in the Heartbreak Hotel
I'm so alone, I could die
Drive down that road tonight, everyone is gone
Nobody's home but the light's always on"
"While in these days of quiet desperation
As I wander through the world in which I live
I search everywhere, for some new inspiration
But it's more than cold reality can give

If I need a cause for celebration
Or a comfort I can use to ease my mind
I rely on my imagination
And I dream of an imaginary time 

[Chorus: ]
I know that everybody has a dream
Everybody has a dream
And this is my dream, my own
Just to be at home
And to be all alone...with you 

If I believe in all the words I'm saying
And if a word from you can bring a better day
Then all I have are these games that I've been playing
To keep my hope from crumbling away

So let me lie and let me go on sleeping
And I will lose myself in palaces of sand
And all the fantasies that I have been keeping
Will make the empty hours easier to stand 

[Chorus: ]

Everybody has a dream... (Repeat)"
"Baby all the lights are turned on you
Now you're in the center of the stage
Everything revolves on what you do
Ah, you are in your prime; you've come of age

And you can always have your way somehow
But everybody loves you now

You can walk away from your mistakes
You can turn your back on what you do
Just a little smile is all it takes
Yeah, you can have your cake and eat it too

Loneliness will get to you somehow
But everybody loves you now

Ah, they all want your white body
And they await your reply
Ah, but between you and me and the Staten Island ferry
So do I

All the people want to know your name
Soon there will be lines outside your door
Feelings do not matter in your game
Yeah, 'cause nothing's gonna touch you anymore

So your life is only living anyhow
And everybody loves you now

Close your eyes when you don't want to see
Stay at home when you don't want to go
Only speak to those who will agree
Yeah, and close your mind when you don't want to know

You have lost you innocence somehow
But everybody loves you now

Ah, you know that nothing lasts forever
And it's all been done before
Ah, but you ain't got the time to go to Cold Spring Harbor
No more

See how all the people gather 'round
Hey, isn't it a thrill to see them crawl?
Keep your eyes ahead and don't look down
Yeah, and lock yourself inside your sacred wall

This is what you wanted; ain't you proud?
Cause everybody loves you now"

"Once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams
There stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes
He painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
And he didn't hear the fallin' of the rain

In the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
And she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade
She was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang
Cause she didn't mind the fallin' of the rain

Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

High upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
With his eyes on the ground; his head is bowed; he is a fool
And his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
But he will not see the fallin' of the rain

Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

So now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
But the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
And it seems that time has brought things to an end; nothing's changed
Cause you can't stop the fallin' rain."
"Sitting here in Avalon, looking at the pouring rain
Summertime has come and gone and everybody's home again

Closing down for the season, I found the last of the souvenirs
I can still taste the wedding cake and it's sweet after all these years

These are the last words I have to say
That's why this took so long to write
There will be other words some other day
But that's the story of my life

There's comfort in my coffee cup and apples in the early fall
They're pulling all the moorings up and gathering at the Legion Hall
They swept away all the streamers after the Labor Day parade
Nothing left for a dream now, only one final serenade

And these are the last words I have to say
Before another age goes by
With all those other songs I'll have to play
But that's the story of my life

And it's so clear standing here where I am
Ain't that what justice is for?
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn anymore

Stack the chairs on the table tops
Hang the sheets on the chandeliers
It slows down but it never stops
Ain't it sweet after all these years

And these are the last words I have to say
It's always hard to say goodbye
But now it's time to put this book away
And that's the story of my life

These are the last words I have to say
That's why this took so long to write
There will be other words some other day
Ain't that the story of my life

These are the last words I have to say
Before another age goes by
With all those other songs I'll have to play
Ain't that the story of my life"
"I don't believe in first impressions
For just this once I hope that looks don't deceive
I ain't got time for true confessions
I've got to make the move right now
Got to meet that girl somehow
I've gotta get it right the first time
That's the main thing, oohh oohh
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time that's not the same thing, ooh ooh
Gonna have to make the first time last
La, la, la, la, la (Repeat)

I'm not much good at conversation
I was never to smooth at comin' on real strong
If all it takes is inspiration
Then I might have just what it takes
If I don't make no bad mistakes and I get it right the first time
That's the main thing
Can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time that's not the same thing
Have to make the first time last
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (Repeat)

I might find the courage, yeah
I might get up the nerve
But if my timing ain't just right
What purpose would it serve?
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know how to say those first few words
If I want to put myself in touch
The first few moments mean so much

So I suppose it's now or never
Before that woman walks right out of my life
Just let me pull myself together
I've got to give it one good try
Gotta take my chance tonight
I've gotta get it right the first time
That's the main thing
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time it's not the same thing
Gonna have to make the first time last
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la (Repeat)"
"I went searching for the truth
But in my innocence I found
All the con men and their acrobats
Who stomped me in the ground
If I count up their percentages
I know they're getting rich
But they haven't taken everything
Those paybacks are a bitch

Though I've lost quite a lot
I am still in control
They can keep what they've got
But they can't have my soul
And if I don't have this all worked out
Still I'm getting closer, getting closer
I still have far to go no doubt
But I'm getting closer, getting closer

What was ripped off by professionals
Is not all that it seems
While I must live up to contracts
I did not give up my dreams
If I see it as experience
It hasn't gone to waste
Lately all the missing pieces
Have been falling into place

And if I could go back and start over somehow
I would not change that much
Knowing what I know now
Thought there have been sins
I will regret
Still I'm getting close, getting closer
I don't have all the answers yet
But I'm getting closer, getting closer

I'm a mark for every shyster
From Topanga to Berlin
And I should have learned to kick them out
As soon as they crawled in
So to every bank in Switzerland
That stores my stolen youth
I'm alright because despite the laws
You cannot hide the truth

And although you will say
I am still too naive
But I have not lost faith
In the things I believe

And if I don't have a this all worked out
Still I'm getting closer, getting closer
I still have far to go no doubt
But I'm still getting closer, getting closer
"
"When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man

You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing, the blues

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road"
"We met as soulmates
On Parris Inland
We left as inmates
From an asylum
And we were sharp
As sharp as knives
And we were so gung
ho to lay down our lives

We came in spastic
Like tameless horses
We left in plastic
As numbered corpses
And we learned fast
To travel light
Our arms were heavy
but our bellies were tight

We had no homefront
We had no soft soap
They sent us playboy
They gave us bob hope
We dug in deep
And shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ
with all of our might

We had no cameras
To shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe
And played our Doors tapes
And it was dark
So dark at night
And we held onto each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write

And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together

Remember Charlie
Remember Baker
They left their childhood
On every acre
And who was wrong
And who was right
It didn't matter
in the thick of the fight

We, held the day
In the palm of our hands
They, ruled the night
And the night, seemed to last
as long as six weeks
On Parris Island
We held the coastline
They held the highland
And they were sharp
As sharp as knives
They heard the hum of the mortars
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive

And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together"
"Well so here I am at the end of the road
Where do I go from here?
I always figured it would be like this
Still nothing seems to be quite clear

All the words have been spoken and the prophecy fulfilled
But I just can't decide where to go
Yes, it's been quite a day and I should go to sleep
But tomorrow I will wake up and I'll know

That I've got to begin again
Though I don't know how to start
Yes, I've got to begin again
And it's hard

Well it's been quite a while since I lifted my head
And I'm sure the light will hurt my eyes
I see the way that I been spendin' my days
And reality has caught me by surprise

I was dreamin' of tomorrow so I sacrificed today
And it sure was a grand waste of time
And despite all the truth that's been thrown in my face
I just can't get you out of my mind

But I've got to begin again
Though I don't know how to start
Yes, I've got to begin again
And it's hard"
"Little Geo is a friend of mine
We get some money and we buy a cheap wine
Sit on the corner and have a holiday
Hide the bottle when the cop goes by
Talk about women and lie, lie, lie
Oh, my other world is just a half a mile away

Wait for mama to turn out the light
Crawl on the the roof and then hit the night
I should be sleeping, but tonight I just can't stay
I've given everybody so much time
Now I need a moment that's mine
Oh, my other world is just a half a mile away

It's just a half a mile away
It's just a half a mile away
It's just a half a mile away

Angelina save a place for me
I've been living someone else's life, and now I've got to be free
Turn your transistor on and let the music play
I try to keep the family satisfied
But there's gotta be more to life than just try, try, try
Oh, my other world is only half a mile away

It's just a half a mile away
It's just a half a mile away
It's just a half a mile away

Those broken-hearted lovers cry away there in their gloom

And when she sees me, she busts out laughing
You're a sad sight honey but you look so cute, and

(CHORUS):
I don't want to be alone anymore
I was checking you out
I was just making sure
No, I don't want to be alone anymore
And I want you tonight
Although you hurt me before
It didn't matter that I felt like a fool
'Cause I forgot when she walked through the door
I said I'm sorry but she said it was cool
And I don't want to be alone anymore

It's so confusing choosing sides
In the heat of the moment
Just to see if it's real
It's so erotic having you
Tell me how it should feel
But I'm avoiding all the hard cold facts
That I've got to face
So ask me just one question
When this magic night is through
Could it have been just anyone
Or did it have to be you
And will you still be saying

(CHORUS)

But don't you know that it's wrong
It's wrong, it's wrong
But like the song
Being caught by the wink of an eye
I can't be sure we'll get along
But I'm willing to try
As long as you can tell me

(CHORUS)"
"Call me a joker, call me a fool
Right at this moment I'm totally cool
Clear as a crystal, sharp as a knife
I feel like I'm in the prime of my life
Sometimes it feels like I'm going too fast
I don't know how long this feeling will last
Maybe it's only tonight

Darling I don't know why I got to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling I don't know why I got to extremes

Sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot
Sometimes I don't know how much more I've got
Maybe I'm headed over the hill
Maybe I've set myself up for the kill
Tell me how much do you think you can take
Until the heart in you is starting to break?
Sometimes it feels like it will

Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling I don't know why I got to extremes

Out of the darkness, into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either I'm wrong or I'm perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?

And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all

Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
And if I stand of I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes

No I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone

"1-2-3-4!

Well, she was just 17,
You know what I mean,
And the way she looked was way beyond compare.
So how could I dance with another (ooh)
And I saw her standin' there.

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her.
She wouldn't dance with another (whoa)
And I saw her standin' there.

Well, my heart went ""boom,""
When I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in mine

Whoa, we danced through the night,
And we held each other tight,
And before too long I fell in love with her.
Now I'll never dance with another (whoa)
Since I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went ""boom,""
When I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in mine

Whoa, we danced through the night,
And we held each other tight,
And before too long I fell in love with her.
Now I'll never dance with another (whoa)
Since I saw her standing there"
"Now we take our time 
So nonchalant 
And spend our nights 
So Bon vivant 
We dress our days 
In silken robes 
The money comes 
The money goes 
We know it's all a passing phase,

We light our lamps 
For atmosphere 
And hang our hopes 
On chandeliers 
We're going long 
We're gaining weight 
We're sleeping long 
And far too late 
And so it's times 
To change our ways 
But I've loved these days. 

Now as we indulge 
In things refined 
We hide our hearts 
From harder times 
A string of pearls 
A foreign car 
Oh we can only go so far 
On caviar and Cabernay. 

We drown our doubts 
In dry champagne 
And soothe our souls 
With fine cocaine 
I don't know why I ever care 
We'll get so high 
And get nowhere 
We'll have to change our jaded ways,
But I've loved these days. 

So before we end 
And then begin 
We'll drink a toast to how it's been 
A few more hours to be complete 
A few more nights on satin sheets 
A few more times that I can say,
I've loved these days."

"If I only had the words to tell you
If you only had the time to understand
Though I know it wouldn't change your feelings
And I know you'll carry on the best you can.

If I only had the urge to tell you
If you only knew how hard it is to say
When the simple lines have all been taken
And the radio repeats them ev'ry day.

If I never find the song to sing you
If you always find it hard to comprehend
Well, you know there wouldn't be much meaning
If I had to sing those tired words again.

Life goes on and on
And tonight will soon be gone
But if we try we can be sure.

If I only had the words to tell you
If you only had the time to understand
But I only have these arms to hold you
And it's all that you can ask of any man.

La la la la, la la la la

If I only had the words to tell you
If you only had the time to understand
Oh, but I only have these arms to hold you
And it's all that you can ask of any man.

"In a sentimental mood, I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude, is like a flame that lights the gloom

On the wings of every kiss, drifts a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss, you make my paradise complete

Rose petals seem to fall, it's all I could dream to call you mine
My heart's a lighter thing, since U made this night a thing divine

In a sentimental mood, I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt that you'd be loving sentimental me

In a sentimental mood, I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt that you'd be loving sentimental me"
"What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?

You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.""

""Can't you tell that it's out of style? ""
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
""Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.""
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene.
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
""You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance.
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers,
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.""
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
""Don't you know that they're out of touch? ""
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
""If you are then you think too much.

"James, we were always friends,
From our childhood days
And we made our plans,
And we had to go our separate ways.
I went on the road-
You pursued an education.

James, do you like your life,
Can you find release,
And will you ever change-
Will you ever write your masterpiece.
Are you still in school-
Living up to expectations, James

You were so relied upon, everybody knows how hard you tried-
Hey, just look at what a job you've done,
Carrying the weight of family pride.
James, you've been well behaved,
You've been working so hard
But will you always stay,
Someone else's dream of who you are.
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody, James.

I went on the road, 
You pursued an education, James
How you gonna know for sure, everything was so well organized.
Hey, now everything is so secure,
And everybody else is satisfied.

James, do you like your life,
Can you find release
And will you ever change,
When will you write your masterpiece.
Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody, James."
"Didn't cha know what I mean
When I said 'I love you Josephine'? Yeah
Josephine.
Nothing I say does justice to you
Or lights up the dasy the way that you do
Josephine.

Like a beautiful queen
You deserve a crown
My Josephine. Yeah
Josephine.
Well I pick up the phone and give you a call
You come around with your sneakers and all
Josephine.

Well
Sit right back. Suppose I went away. Ah
Honey.
Would your love turn sour and moldy green?
When I take from you the light of yoodle-eh-hi-hoo
Would I make you sad
My Josephine?

You arrived on the scene
You made me glad I'm alive
My Josephine. Yeah
Josephine.Well
Nothing I say does justice to you
Lights up the day the way that you do

Oh no

Still I would not be here now
If I never had the hunger
And I'm not ashamed to say
The wild boys were my friends
Oh
Cause I never felt the desire
'Til their music set me on fire
And then I was saved, yeah
That's why I'm keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith

We wore matador boots
Only Flagg Brothers had them with the Cuban heel
Iridescent socks with the same color shirt
And a tight pair of chinos
Oh
I put on my shark skin jacket
You know the kind with the velvet collar
And ditty-bop shades
Oh yeah
I took a fresh pack of Luckies
And a mint called Sen-Sen
My old man's Trojans
And his Old Spice after shave
Oh
Combed my hair in a pompadour
Like the rest of the Romeos wore
A permanent wave
Yeah
We were keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith

You can get just so much
From a good thing
You can linger too long
In your dreams
Say goodbye to the
Oldies but goodies
Cause the good ole days weren't
Always good
And tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems

Learned stickball as a formal education
Lost a lot of fights
But it taught me how to lose O.K.
Oh
I heard about sex
But not enough
I found you could dance
And still look tough anyway
Oh yes I did
I found out a man ain't just being macho
Ate an awful lot of late night drive-in food
Drank a lot of take-home pay
I thought I was the Duke of Earl
When I made it with a red-haired girl
In the Chevrolet
Oh yeah
We were keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith

You know the good ole days weren't
Always good
And tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems

Now I told you my reasons
For the whole revival
Now I'm going outside to have
An ice cold beer in the shade
Oh
I'm going to listen to my 45's
Ain't it wonderful to be alive
When the rock 'n' roll plays
Yeah
When the memory stays
Yeah
I'm keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith
I'm keeping the faith
Yes I am"
"Well if money makes a rich man
Then I might never make the grade
I'll be a small time operator
If I just get the landlord paid
But if time is an indication
Of the wealth that I never knew
Then I'm the last of the big time spenders
'Cause I've been spending time on you, woo oo oo woo

It takes time to appreciate
Lord knows that you can learn to hate it
I believe, 'cause I've been there too
When it gets down to desperation
You make the best of the situation
I can tell, I've seen it through, oh, oh, oh

Though it seems like the day is wasted
And the nights have been overdue
Well, I'm the last of the big time spenders
And I've been spendin' time on you, woo oo oo woo

It's been so long since we got together
In between it seems to take forever
But I'm a dreamer, I'll be there soon

It takes time to appreciate
All of those that you can learn to hate
I believe, I've seen it through, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You can call me the Great Pretender
And in a way it might be true
But I'm the last of the big time spenders

"Laura calls me
In the middle of the night
Passes on her
Fateful information
Then these careless fingers
They get caught in her vise
'Til they're bleeding
On my coffee table

Living alone isn't all that
It's cracked up to be
Oh, oh, oh
I'm on her side
Why does she push the poison on me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Laura
Has a very hard time
All her life has
Been one long disaster
Then she tells me
She suddenly believes she's seen a very good sign
She'll be taking
Some aggressive action

I fight her wars
While she's slamming her doors in my face
Oh, oh, oh
Failure to break
Was the only mistake that she made
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Here I am
Feeling like a fucking fool
Do I react the way exactly
She intends me to?
Every time I think I'm off the hook
She makes me lose my cool
I'm her machine
And she can punch all the keys
She can push any button I was programmed through

Laura calls me
When she needs a good fix (ah)
All her questions
Will get sympathetic answers
I should be so immunized
To all of her tricks (ah)
She's surviving
On her second chances

Sometimes I feel like this
Godfather deal is all wrong
Oh, oh, oh
How can she hold an umbilical chord
For so long?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I've done everything I can
What else am I supposed to do
I'm her machine
And she can punch all the keys
She can push any button I was programmed through

Laura (Laura) loves me (loves me)
Even if I don't care (if I don't care)
That's my problem
That's her sacred absolution
If she had to
She would put herself in my chair (self in my chair)
Even though I
Faced electrocution

She always says
I'm the best friend that she's ever had
Oh, oh, oh
How do you hang up on someone
Who needs you that bad?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
"Even though I'm in love
Sometimes I get so afraid
I'll say something so wrong

To keep the conversation light

But if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've even known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone

Yes I know I'm in love
But just when I ought to relax
I put my foot in my mouth
Cause I'm just avoiding the facts

If the girl gets too close
If I need some room to escape
When the moment arose
I'd tell her it's all a mistake

But that's not how I feel
No that's not the woman I've known
She's undeniably real
So leave a tender moment alone

But it's not only me
Breaking down when the tension gets high
Just when I'm in a serious mood
She is suddenly quiet and shy

Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone

I know the moment isn't right
To hold my emotions inside
To change the attitude tonight
I've run out of places to hide

And if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've even known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone

You got to leave a tender moment alone
Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone
You've got to leave a tender moment
Leave a tender moment alone"

If the girl gets too close
If I need some room to escape
When the moment arose
I'd tell her it's all a mistake

But that's not how I feel
No that's not the woman I've known
She's undeniably real
So leave a tender moment alone

But it's not only me
Breaking down when the tension gets high
Just when I'm in a serious mood
She is suddenly quiet and shy

Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone

I know the moment isn't right
To hold my emotions inside
To change the attitude tonight
I've run out of places to hide

And if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've even known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone

You got to leave a tender moment alone
Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone
You've got to leave a tender moment
Leave a tender moment alone"
"Victor was born 
The spring of '44 
And never saw 
His father anymore 
The child of sacrifice 
Child of war 
Another son who never had 
A father after Leningrad 
Went off to school 
And learned to serve his state 
Follow the rules 
And drank his vodka straight 
The only way to live 
Was drown the hate 
The Russian life was very sad 
And such was life in Leningrad 

I was born in '49 
A cold war kid in the McCarthy times
Stop 'em at the 38th parallel 
Blast those yellow reds to hell 
Cold war kids were hard to kill 
Under their desks in an air raid drill 
Haven't they heard we won the war 
What do they keep on fighting for? 

Victor was sent 
To some red army town 
Served out his time 
Become a circus clown 
The greatest happiness 
He'd ever found 
Was making Russian children glad 
When children lived in Leningrad. 

The children lived in Levittown 
Hid in the shelters underground 
Til the soviets turned their ships around 
Torn the Cuban missiles down 
And in that bright October sun 
We knew our childhood days were done 
I watched my friends go off to war 
What do they keep on fighting for? 
 
So my child and I came to this place 
To meet him , eye to eye and face to face 
He made my daughter laugh 
Then we embraced 
We never knew what friends we had 
Until we came to Leningrad."
"When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be"
"She stands before you naked
You can see it, you can taste it
But she comes to you
Light as the breeze
You can drink or you can nurse it
It don't matter how you worship
As long as you're
Down on your knees 

So I knelt there at the delta
At the alpha and the omega
At the cradle of the river
And the seas
And like a blessing come from heaven,
For something like a second,
I was healed, and my heart
Was at ease 

O baby I waited
So long for your kiss
For something to happen
Oh, something like this 

And you're weak and you're harmless
And you're sleeping in you harness
And the wind going wild
In the trees
And it's not exactly prison
But you'll never be forgiven
For whatever you've done
With the keys 

O baby I waited
So long for your kiss
For something to happen
Oh, something like this 

It's dark and it's snowing
Oh my love I must be going
The river is starting to freeze
And I'm sick of pretending
I'm broken from bending
I've lived too long
On my knees 

And she dances so graceful
And your heart's hard and hateful
And she's naked
But that's just a tease
And you turn in disgust
From your hatred and from your love
And she comes to you
Light as the breeze 

O baby I waited
So long for your kiss
For something to happen
Oh, something like this 

There's blood on every bracelet
You can see it, you can taste it
And it's please baby
Please baby please
And she says, drink deeply, pilgrim
But don't forget there's still a woman
Beneath this
Resplendent chemise 

So I knelt there at the delta
At the alpha and omega
I knelt there
Like one who believes
And like a blessing come from heaven
For something like a second
I was cured, and my heart
Was at ease 

O baby I waited
So long for your kiss
For something to happen
Oh, something like this"
"When you were young
And your heart was an open book

You used to say, ""live and let live""
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we're livin'
Makes you give in and cry

Say live and let die
Live and let die
Live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya, when you've got a job to do, you gotta do it well
You gotta give the other fellow hell

You used to say, ""live and let livin'""
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we're livin'
Makes you give in and cry

Say live and let die
Live and let die
Live and let die
Live and let die"
"Los Angelenos
All come from somewhere
To live in sunshine
Their funky exile
Midwestern ladies
High-heeled and faded
Drivin' sleek new sports cars
With their New York cowboys

Hiding up in the mountains
Laying low in the canyons
Goin' nowhere on the streets
With their Spanish names
Makin' love with the natives
In their Hollywood places
Making up for all the time gone by

Los Angelenos
All come from somewhere
'cause it's all so easy
To become acquainted
Electric babies
Blue-jeaned and jaded
Such hot sweet schoolgirls
So educated

Tanning out in the beaches
With their Mexican reefers
No one ever has to feel
Like a refugee
Going into garages
For exotic massages
Making up for all the time gone by


Hiding up in the mountains
Laying low in the canyons
Goin' nowhere on the streets
With the Spanish names
Makin' love with the natives
In their Hollywood places
Making up for all the time gone by

Los Angelenos
All come from somewhere
It's so familiar
Their foreign faces

"Goodnight, my angel
Time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day
I think I know what you've been asking me
I think you know what I've been trying to say
I promised I would never leave you
And you should always know
Wherever you may go
No matter where you are
I never will be far away

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark and deep
Inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me

Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu 
lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart
There will always be a part of me

Someday we'll all be gone
But lullabyes go on and on
They never die
That's how you
And I
Will be"

"Maybe he'll know
I'm not so sure
Maybe he'll know
Maybe he'll be my cure
Ah, ah, ah.

Maybe he'll know
I'm not so sure
Maybe he'll know
Maybe he'll be - oh

Something calls to me
I know, I know
I hear an echo start to pound like a drum, I'm
Chanting a song, anchor me-
But don't take too long...no, no, no, no

I got an anxious feeling
Got this ache engraved in me like stone-
Don't take too long
Say you'll never leave me say you'll never go."
"Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time 
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you 
Maybe I'm amazed at the the way you pulled me out of time 
And hung me on a line 
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you. 

Maybe I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man 
Who's in the middle of something 
That he doesn't really understand. 

Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman 
Who could ever help me 
Baby won't you help me understand. 

Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time 
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you 
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song 
Right me when I'm wrong 
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you."
"Seen the lights go out Broadway
I saw the Empire State laid low
And life went on beyond the Palisades
They all bought Cadillacs
And left there long ago 

They held a concert out in Brooklyn
To watch the island bridges blow
They turned our power down
And drove us underground
But we went right on with the show 

I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the ruins at my feet
You know we almost didn't notice it
We'd seen it all the time on Forty second street 

They burned the churches up in Harlem
Like in that Spanish civil war
The flames were everywhere
But no one really cared
It always burned up there before 

I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the mighty skyline fall
The boats were waiting at the Battery
The union went on strike
They never sailed at all 

They sent a carrier out from Norfolk
And picked the Yankees up for free
They said that Queens could stay
And blew the Bronx away
And sank Manhattan out at sea 

You know those lights were bright on Broadway
That was so many years ago
Before we all lived here in Florida
Before the Mafia took over Mexico
There are not many who remember
They say a handful still survive
To tell the world about
The way the lights went out
And keep the memory alive"

"You see her sitting with her coffee and her paper
With her high top sneakers of Italian design
With a long cool stare she aggravates the tension
Makes up her face while she makes up her mind

Now you're in trouble, maybe she's an intellectual
What if she figures out you're not very smart
Or maybe she's the quiet type who's into heavy metal
Boy, you got to get it settled
Cause she's breaking your heart

Don't try to put on an act
You can't do that to a modern woman
And you're an old fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman

She looks sleek and she seems so professional
She's got a lot of confidence, it's easy to see
You want to make a move
But you feel so inferior
Cause under that exterior
Is someone who's free

She's got style and she's got her own money
So she's not another honey you can quickly disarm
She's got the eyes that make you realize
She won't be hypnotized by your usual charm

You've got your plan of attack
That won't attract the modern woman
Whe you're an old fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman

Time goes by and you're sharing an apartment
She says she loves you but she doesn't know why
In the morning she leaves you with your coffee and your paper
It's a strange situation for an old fashioned guy

But times have changed
Things are not the same, baby
You overcame such a bad attitude
Rock and roll just used to be for kicks
And nowadays it's politics
And after 1986 what else could be new

You got to learn to relax
And face the facts of modern woman
And you're an old fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman"

"Got a call from an old friend we'd used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone

I never said you had to offer me a second chance
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
I still belong
Don't get me wrong
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time

They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you can't sleep with somebody else
Ah but sooner or later you sleep in your own space
Either way it's O.K. you wake up with yourself

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life

"I've seen those big machines come rolling through the quiet pines
Blue suits and bankers with their Volvos and their valentines
Give us this day our daily discount outlet merchandise
Raise up a multiplex and we will make a sacrifice
Now we're gonna get the big business
Now we're gonna get the real thing
Everybody's all excited about it

Who remembers when it all began
Out here in no man's land
Before they passed the master plan
Out here in no man's land
Low supply and high demand
Here in no man's land

There ain't much work out here in our consumer power base
No major industry, just miles and miles of parking space
This morning's paper says our neighbor's in a cocaine bust
Lots more to read about Lolita and suburban lust
Now we're gonna get the whole story
Now we're gonna be in prime time
Everybody's all excited about it

Who remembers when it all began
Out here in no man's land
We've just begun to understand
Out here in no man's land
Low supply and high demand
Here in no man's land

I see these children with their boredom and their vacant stares
God help us all if we're to blame for their unanswered prayers
They roll the sidewalks up at night, this place goes underground
Thanks to the condo kings there's cable now in Zombietown
Now we're gonna get the closed circuit
Now we're gonna get the Top 40
Now we're gonna get the sports franchise
Now we're gonna get the major attractions

Who remembers when it all began
Out here in no man's land
Before the whole world was in our hands
Out here in no man's land
Before the banners and the marching bands
Out here in no man's land
Low supply and high demand
Here in no man's land

But my friend is sitting on the edge of the day, turns from the evening into night

But everybody says he took a stage on him and everybody says I'm just a kid
Faith in the tunnel took the places on him
Well looky-looky-looky, well my fingers are ditty-ditty-ditty
Wop-bop-bop-a-lup-bop-a-lop-bam-boom

"Come out Virginia, don't let 'em wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aw but sooner or later it comes down to faith
Oh I might as well be the one

Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
Aw, but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done
Only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aw but that never hurt no one

So come on Virginia show me a sign
Send up a signal and I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never let's in the sun
Darlin' only the good die young
Woah
I tell ya
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But Virginia they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
(Oh woah woah)

They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun

You know that only the good die young
I tell ya
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Well your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation
Aw she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me? oh woah woah

Come out come out come out Virginia don't let 'em wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Oh sooner or later it comes down to faith
Oh I might as well be the one
You know that only the good die young

I'm telling you baby
You know that only the good die young

For things that you might have done
Only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aw but that never hurt no one

So come on Virginia show me a sign
Send up a signal and I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never let's in the sun
Darlin' only the good die young
Woah
I tell ya
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But Virginia they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
(Oh woah woah)

They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun

You know that only the good die young
I tell ya
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Well your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation
Aw she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me? oh woah woah

Come out come out come out Virginia don't let 'em wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Oh sooner or later it comes down to faith
Oh I might as well be the one
You know that only the good die young

I'm telling you baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good
Only the good die young"
"It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

La la la, le li la
La la, le li la, da dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la la la, de di da
La la, de di da, da dum

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you got us feelin' alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Oh, la la la, de di da
La la, de di da, da dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you got us feelin' alright"

"There's a black man with a black cat
Living in a black neighborhood
He's got an interstate running' through his front yard
You know, he thinks, he's got it so good
And there's a woman in the kitchen cleaning' up evening slop
And he looks at her and says: 
""Hey darling, I can remember when you could stop a clock""
 
Oh but ain't that America, for you and me
Ain't that America, we're something to see baby
Ain't that America, home of the free, yeah
Little pink houses for you and me, oh for you and me

Well there's a young man in a T-shirt
Listenin' to a rock 'n' roll station
He's got a greasy hair, greasy smile
He says: ""Lord, this must be my destination""
'Cause they told me, when I was younger
Sayin' ""Boy, you're gonna be president""
But just like everything else, those old crazy dreams
Just kinda came and went
 
Oh but ain't that America, for you and me
Ain't that America, we're something to see baby
Ain't that America, home of the free, yeah
Little pink houses, for you and me, oh baby for you and me

Well there's people and more people
What do they know, know, know
Go to work in some high rise
And vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico
Ooo yeah

And there's winners, and there's losers
But they ain't no big deal
'Cause the simple man baby pays the thrills,
The bills and the pills that kill
 
Oh but ain't that America, for you and me
Ain't that America, we're something to see baby
Ain't that America, home of the free, yeah
Little pink houses for you and me, ooo, ooo yeah

"There's a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl
He's always at home with his back to the wall
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man

Give a moment or two to the angry young man
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good
And he sits in a room with a lock on the door
With his maps and his medals laid out on the floor
And he likes to be known as the angry young man

I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage
I found that just surviving was a noble fight
I once believed in causes too
I had my pointless point of view
And life went on no matter who was wrong or right

And there's always a place for the angry young man
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand
And he's never been able to learn from mistakes
So he can't understand why his heart always breaks
But his honor is pure and his courage as well
And he's fair and he's true and he's boring as hell
And he'll go to the grave as an angry old man

There's a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl
He's always at home with his back to the wall
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man"

"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep

I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep

And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep

I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind

In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep

We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

In the middle of the night"
"Roberta, you say you know me
But I see only what you're paid to show me 
Oh, I wish you had the time 
Oh, I wish you had the time 

Oh, Roberta, I understand you
I know you need to move in other circles too; 
It's tough for me, it's tough for you

Roberta, how I've adored you 
I'd ask you over but I can't afford you
Oh, I wish you'd take the time 
Oh, I wish you'd take the time 

Oh, Roberta, the night goes slowly
I know you're workin' but you must get lonely too; 
It's tough for me, ah, it's tough for you

And I'm in a bad way and wanna make love to you, ooh, ooh 

Oh, I wish you had the time
Oh, I wish you had the time
Oh, Roberta, I really need you 
But I suppose that my small change won't see you through; 
It's tough for me, ah, it's tough for you

"I play nights in the Spanish part of town
I've got music in my hands
The work is hard to find
But that don't get me down
Rosalinda understands

Crazy Latin dancing solo down in Herald Square
Oh Havana I've been searching for you everywhere
And though I'll neverer be there
I know what I would see there
I can always find my Cuban skies
In Rosalinda's eyes

When she smiles she gives everything to me
When she's all alone she cries
And I'd do anything to take away her tears
Because they're Rosalinda's eyes

Senorita don't be lonely, I will soo be there
Oh Havana I've been searching for you everywhere
I've got a chance to make it
It's time for me to take it
I'll return before the fire dies
In Rosalinda's eyes

All alone in a Puerto Rican baand
Union wages, wedding clothes
Hardly anyone has seen how good I am
But Rosalinda says she knows

Crazy Latin dancing solo down in Herald Square
Oh Havana I've been searching for you everywhere
And though I'll never be there
I know what I would see there
I can always find my Cuban skies
In Rosalinda's eyes"
"There's a lot of tension in this town
I know it's building up inside of me
I've got all the symptoms and the side effects
Of city life anxiety

I could never understand why the urban attitude
Is so superior
In a world of high rise ambition
Most people's motives are ulterior

Sometimes I feel as though I'm running on ice
Paying the price too long
Kind of get the feeling that I'm running on ice
Where did my life go wrong

I'm a cosmopolitan sophisticate
Of culture and intelligence
The culmination of technology
And civilized experience

But I'm carrying the weight of all the useless junk
A modern man accumulates
I'm a statistic in a system
That a civil servant dominates

And all that means is that I'm running on ice
Caught in the vise so strong
I'm slipping and sliding, cause I'm running on ice
Where did my life go wrong

You've got to run
You've got to run

As fast as I can climb
A new disaster every time I turn around
As soon as I get one fire put out
There's another building burning down

They say this highway's going my way
But I don't know where it's taking me
It's a bad waste, a sad case, a rat race
It's breaking me

I get no traction cause I'm running on ice
It's taking me twice as long
I get a bad reaction cause I'm running on ice
Where did my life go wrong

You've got to run
You've got to run

Running on ice
Running on ice
Running on ice
Running on ice

"Bobby's driving through the city tonight
Through the lights
In a hot new rent a car
He joins the lover in his heavy machine
It's a scene down on Sunset Boulevard

Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby

Johnny's taking care of things for awhile
And his style is so right for troubadours
They got him sitting with his back to the door
Now he won't be my fast gun anymore

Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby

Moving on is a chance that you take every time
You try to stay together
Say a word out of line and you find
That the friends you had are gone
Forever, forever
So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last, some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again

Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby

Moving on is a chance that you take every time

"The sins of Amsterdam
Were still a recent surprise
And we were flying over
Scandinavian Skies
We climbed towards the sun
We turned and cursed as one
We pulled the shades
And closed our eyes
The Stockholm city lights
Were slowly starting to rise
And we were strapped against
Those Scandinavian skies
The landing gear came down
And touched the Swedish ground
And we were all so paralyzed
On the plane
We were mainly sound and lights
In the veins
We could play the blues all night
The tour of Germany
Was bleeding into our eyes
And we were sailing over
Scandinavian skies
We had the Midas touch
Until we met the Dutch
And they exhausted our supplies
Who's to pay?
For this international flight
Who could stay
We were only there for the night
We watched the power fall
Inside the Olso hall
While all the cold Norweigians cried
Who could say
What was left and where was right?
By the way
I could play the blues all night

"A bottle of white, a bottle of red
Perhaps a bottle of rose instead
We'll get a table near the street
In our old familiar place
You and I, face to face

A bottle of red, a bottle of white
It all depends upon your appetite
I'll meet you any time you want
In our Italian Restaurant

Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, got a good office
Got a new wife, got a new life
And the family's fine
We lost touch long ago
You lost weight I did not know
You could ever look so nice after
So much time

Do you remember those days hanging out
At the village green
Engineer boots, leather jackets
And tight blue jeans
Drop a dime in the box play the
Song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights

Brenda and Eddie were the
Popular steadys
And the king and the queen
Of the prom
Riding around with the car top
Down and the radio on
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the
Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more
Than that out of life
Surely Brenda and Eddie would
Always know how to survive

Brenda and Eddy were still going
Steady in the summer of '75
When they decided the marriage would
Be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
Brenda you know you're much too lazy
Eddie could never afford to live that
Kind of life
But there we were wavin' Brenda and
Eddie goodbye

They got an apartment with deep
Pile carpet
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought
With the bread
They had saved for a couple
Of years
They started to fight when the
Money got tight
And they just didn't count on
The tears.

They lived for a while in a
Very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter
Of course
And they parted the closest
Of friends
Then the king and the queen went
Back to the green
But you can never go back
There again

Brenda and Eddie had had it
Already by the summer of '75
From the high to the low to
The end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to
The greasers
The best they could do was
Pick up the pieces
We always knew they would both
Find a way to get by
That's all I heard about
Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more than I
Told you already
And here we are wavin' Brenda

Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!


Some things were perfectly clear, seen with the vision of youth

No doubts and nothing to fear, I claimed the corner on truth

These days it's harder to say I know what I'm fighting for

My faith is falling away

I'm not that sure anymore


Shades of grey wherever I go

The more I find out the less that I know

Black and white is how it should be

But shades of grey are the colors I see


Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!

Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!


Once there were trenches and walls and one point of every view

Fight 'til the other man falls

Kill him before he kills you

These days the edges are blurred, I'm old and tired of war

I hear the other man's words

I'm not that sure anymore


Shades of grey are all that I find

When I look to the enemy line

Black and white was so easy for me

But shades of grey are the colors I see


Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!

Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!


Now with the wisdom of years I try to reason things out

And the only people I fear are those who never have doubts

Save us all from arrogant men, and all the causes they're for

I won't be righteous again

I'm not that sure anymore


Shades of grey are all that I find

When I look to the enemy line

There ain't no rainbows shining on me

Shades of grey are the colors I see


Shades of grey wherever I go

The more I find out the less that I know

There ain't no rainbows shining on me

Shades of grey are the colors I see

"Well I'm shameless when it comes to loving you
I'd do anything you want me to
I'd do anything at all

And I'm standing here for all the world to see
There ain't that much left of me
That has very far to fall

You know I'm not a man who has ever been
Insecure about the world I've been living in
I don't break easy, I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied

I'm shameless, baby I don't have a prayer
Anytime I see you standing there
I go down upon my knees

And I'm changing, I swore I'd never compromise
But you convinced me otherwise
I'll do anything you please

You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you

I have never let anything have this much 
Control over me
Cause I worked too hard to call my life my own
Yes I made myself a world 
And it worked so perfectly
But it's your world now, I can't refuse
I never had so much to lose
I'm shameless, shameless

You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I ever missed
But I've never been in love like this

It's out of my hands

I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
But I don't want it anyhow
So I've got to let it go

I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be
You can make a total fool of me
I just wanted you to know

I am shameless
Shameless
Shameless"
"She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child but she's always a woman to me
She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free

Yeah she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me
Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, she never gives out and she never gives in
She just changes her mind

And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding
But she brings out the best and the worst you can be

Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a woman to me
Oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, she never gives out and she never gives in
She just changes her mind

She is frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool
But she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you

Inspires me without a sound

"Turn on all the Christmas lights
Cause baby's coming home tonight
I can hear her footsteps in the street
Turn the choral music higher
Pile more wood upon the fire
That should make the atmosphere complete
I've had to wait forever
But better late than never
She's just in time for me
She's right on time
She's right where she should be
She's right on time
I'm a man with so much tension
Far too many sins to mention
She don't have to take it anymore
But since she said she's coming home
I've torn out all my telephones
Soon she will be walking through that door
I may be going nowhere
But I don't mind if she's there
She's just in time for me
She's right on time
She's right where she should be
She's right on time
Left to my own device
I can always make believe
That there's nothing wrong
Still I will chose to live
In the complicated world
That we shared for so long
Good or bad
Right or wrong
And it occurred to me
While I set up my Christmas tree
She never missed a cue
Or lost a beat
Everytime I lost the meter
There she was when I would need her
Greeting me with footsteps in the street
I guess I should have known it
She'd find the perfect moment
She's just in time for me
She's right on time
She's right where she should be
She's right on time
Turn the choral music higher
Pile more wood upon the fire
That will make the atmosphere complete
I've had to wait forever
But better late than never
She's just in time for me
She's right on time
She's right where she should be
She's right on time
She's right on time
She's right on time

Shout

These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really really ought to know
Those one track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to shout for joy

Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

Shout

Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on

If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to break your heart

"I've been watching you waltz all night Diane
Nobody's found a way behind your defenses
They never notice the zap gun in your hand
Until you're pointing it and stunning their senses 

All night long, all night long
You'll shoot 'em down because you're waiting for somebody good to come on
All night long, all night long
But you're sleeping with the television on 

You say you're looking for someone solid here
You can't be bothered with those 'just for the night' boys
Tonight unless you take some kind of chances dear
Tomorrow morning you'll wake up with a white noise 

All night long, all night long
You're only standing there 'cause somebody once did somebody wrong
All night long, all night long
But you'll be sleeping with the television on 

You're eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me
But your attitude is ""don't waste my time""
Your eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me
But you won't hear a word 'cause it just might be the same old line 

This isn't really easy for me to say Diane
I know you don't need anybody's protection
I really wish I was less of a thinking man
And more a fool who's not afraid of rejection 

All night long, all night long
I'll just be standing here 'cause I know I don't have the guts to come on
All night long, all night long
And I'll be sleeping with the television on 

You're eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me
But my attitude is ""boy, don't waste my time""
Your eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me
But I won't say a word 'cause it just might be somebody else's same old line 

All night long, all night long
We're only standing here 'cause somebody might do somebody wrong
All night long, all night long
And we'll be sleeping with the television on
Sleeping with the television on
Sleeping with the television on"
"I didn't want to do it but I got too lonely
I had to call you up in the middle of the night
I know it's awful hard to try to make love long distance
But I really needed stimulation
Though it was only my imagination

It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
But sometimes a fantasy
Is all you need

When am I gonna take control get a hold of my emotions
Why does it only seem to hit me in the middle of the night
You told me there's a number I can always dial for assistance
I don't want to deal with outside action
Only you can give me satisfaction

It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
But sometimes a fantasy
Is all you need

Sure it would be better if I had you here to hold me
Be better baby but believe me it's the next best thing
I'm sure there's many times you've wanted me to hear your secrets
Don't be afraid to say the words that move me
Anytime you want to tell them to me

It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
But sometimes a fantasy
Is all you need
It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing"
"Well, it's a rainy night in Paris,
And I'm sitting by the Seine,
It's a pleasure to be soaking in the European rain,
Now my belly's full of fancy food and wine
Oh but in the morning there'll be hell to pay
Somewhere along the line
In the morning there'll be hell hell to pay
Somewhere along the line 

Sweet Virginia cigarette burin' in my hand
Well you used to be a friend of mine but now I understand
You've been eating up inside me for some time
Oh and I know you're gonna get me
Somewhere along the line
Well I know you're gonna get me
Somewhere along the line
Somewhere along the line
Well I know it's just a matter of time
Well the fun falls through and the rent comes due
Somewhere along the line 

Well you know I love my woman,
And I would not let her down,
And I did my share of lovin' when I used to get around
Now I'm satisfied,
And she is lookin' fine
Oh but you pay for your satisfaction
Somewhere along the line
But you pay for your satisfaction
Somewhere along the line 

Hey it's good to be a young man
And to live the way you please
Yes a young man is the king of ev'ry kingdom that he sees
But there's an old and feeble man not far behind
Oh that surely will catch up to him
Somewhere along the line
That surely will catch up to him
Somewhere along the line"
"A picture postcard
A folded stub
A program of the play
File away your photographs
Of your holiday

And your mementos
Will turn to dust
But that's the price you pay
For every year's a souvenir
That slowly fades away
Every year's a souvenir
That slowly fades away"
"There you go, slipping away into a state of grace
I know the look that comes across your face
It's so familiar to me
Here I am, trying to keep you in my line of sight
I'm never certain that you read me right
Sometimes you don't want to see me

Here we are, both of us know we're in love
But that isn't always enough
I never could rise above it all, down I fall

But darling there you go, slipping away into a state of grace
Granted, this world is not a perfect place
Still it's the world that I'm in
Here I am talking while 
You don't hear a word I say
Knowing you're watching me from far away
Somewhere that I've never been

Don't you see, you lived a different life than me
It don't mean you have to be afraid of how
We're not the same, don't leave me now

But darling there you go, slipping away

How can I get you to stay where you are
Keep you from going too far
Holding you here is so hard to do
I'm losing you

And darling there you go, slipping away into a state of grace
Drifting away into your sacred place
Someplace that I've never been
There you go, slipping away, slipping away into a state of grace
There you go, slipping away into a state of grace
Yeah, drifting away into that sacred place

There you go, slipping away"
"She cuts you once, she cuts you twice 
But still you believe 
The wound is so fresh you can taste the blood 
BUt you don't have strength to leave 
You've been bought, you've been sold 
You've been locked outside the door 
But you stand there pleadin', 
With your insides bleedin', 
'Cause you deep down want some more 
Then she says she wants forgiveness 
It's such a clever masquerade 
She's so good with her stiletto 
You don't even see the blade 

She cuts you hard, she cuts you deep, 
She's got so much skill 
She's so fascinating that you're still there waiting 
When she comes back for the kill 
You've been slashed in the face 
You've been left there to bleed 
You want to run away 
But you know you're gonna stay 
'Cause she gives you what you need 
Then she says she wants affection 
While she searches for the vein 
She's so good with her stiletto 
You don't really mind the pain 

She cuts you out, she cuts you down 
She carves up your life 
But you won't do nothng 
As she keeps on cutting 
'Cause you know you love the knife 
You've been bought, you've been sold 
You've been locked outside the door 
But you stand there pleadin' 
With your insides bleedin' 
'Cause you deep down want some more 
Then she says she needs affection

"He always found it hard to take her
She wouldn't listen to advice
And though he never tried to make her
She often thought it would be nice

Oh, and now she's headin' out to California
It's been a long time comin' but she's feeling like a woman tonight
And she left a little letter said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye, goodbye.

She tried for years to be a good wife
It never quite got off the ground
And all those stories of the good life
Convinced her not to hang around

Oh, and now she's heading out to California
And she doesn't know what's comin' but she's sure of what she's leaving behind
And she left a little letter said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye, goodbye.

And though she finds it hard to leave him
She knows it would be worse to stay
He wouldn't understand the reasons
That make a woman run away

Oh, and now she's heading out to California
With some money in her pocket she's a rocket on the fourth of July
And she left a little letter said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye, goodbye.

"Safe at harbor, everything is easy
Off to starboard, daylight comes up fast
Now I'm restless for the open water
Red flags are flying fromhe Coast Guard mast
They told me to stay, I heard all the information
I motored away and steered straight ahead
Though the weatherman said

CHORUS
There's a storm front coming (mood indigo)
White water running and the pressure is low
Storm front coming (mood indigo)
Small craft warning on the radio

I've been sailing a long time on this ocean
Man gets lonesome, all those years at sea
I've got a woman, my life should be easy
Most men hunger for the life I lead
The morning was gray, but I had the motivation
I drifted away and ran into more
Heavy weather off shore

CHORUS

We've got a low pressure system and a northeast breeze
We've got a falling barometer and rising seas
We've got the cumulonimbus and a possible gale
We've got a force nine blowing on the Beaufort scale

I'm still restless for the open water
Though she gives me everything I need
She asked me to stay, but I'd done my navigation
I drove her away, but I should have known
To stay tied up at home

CHORUS

"Streetlife serenader
Never sang on stages
Needs no orchestration
Melody comes easy

Midnight masquerader
Shoppin' center heroes
Child of Eisenhower
New world celebrator

Streetlife serenaders
Have such understanding
How the words are spoken
How to make the motions

Streetlife serenaders
Have no obligations
Hold no grand illusions
Need no stimulation

Midnight masqueraders
Workin' hard for wages
Need no vast arrangements
To do their harmonizing

"They say that these are not the best of times
But they're the only times I've ever known
And I believe there is a time for meditation
In cathedrals of our own

Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes
And I can only stand apart and sympathize
For we are always what our situations hand us
It's either sadness or euphoria

So we'll argue and we'll compromise
And realize that nothing's ever changed
For all our mutual experience
Our separate conclusions are the same

Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
A reason coexists with our insanity
Though we choose between reality and madness
It's either sadness or euphoria

How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
Perhaps we'll help fulfill each other's fantasies
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives with our respective similarities
It's either sadness or euphoria"

"Don't get excited
Don't say a word
Nobody noticed
Nothing was heard
It was committed discreetly
It was handled so neatly
And it shouldn't surprise you at all
You know
Break all the records
Burn the cassettes
I'd be lying if I told you
That I had no regrets
There were so many mistakes
And what a difference it makes
But still it shouldn't surprise you at all
You know
I said it shouldn't surprise you at all
You know
Don't look now but you have changed
Your best friends wouldn't tell you
Now it's apparent
Now it's a fact
So marshal your forces
For another attack
You were so young and naive
I know it's hard to believe
But now it shouldn't surprise you at all
You know
No it shouldn't surprise you at all
You know
What has it cost you
What have you won
The sins of the fathers
Are the sins of the sons
It was always within you
It will always continue
But it shouldn't surprise you at all
You know
I said it shouldn't surprise you at all
You know

"Listen boy
I don't want to see you let a good thing
Slip away

You know I don't like watching
Anybody make the same mistakes
I made

She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

Listen boy
I'm sure that you think you got it all
Under control

You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul

You're a big boy now
You'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing
She ought to know

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Listen boy
It's not automatically a certain guarantee
To insure yourself
You've got to provide communication constantly

When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way
To reassure

Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there

Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe

'Cause now and then
She'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken
For so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone

Listen boy
It's good information from a man
Who's made mistakes

Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes

She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you
What you should do

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it
Tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want
To wait, you got to
Tell her about it"

You know I don't like watching 
Anybody make the same mistakes 
I made

And she's always there for you 
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do 

Listen boy 
I'm sure that you think you got it all 
Under control 

You don't want somebody telling you 
The way to stay in someone's soul

You'll never let her go

"It's time for me to be on my way I know
I've got business to conduct
And I've got places to go
But I can't help looking at her sleeping instead
Another morning I'll have trouble climbing out of this bed
Because - she's such a temptation
It's driving me crazy
And it's my fascination
That's making me act this way
And I know what all my friends say
They're afraid that I'm losing my touch
But she's such a temptation

I look so tired cause I don't get much sleep
And I've got too many commitments that are too hard to keep
And I try to be rational
And I try to be wise
But it all gets blown to pieces
When I look in her eyes
Because - She's such a temptation
And nothing can save me

And my only salvation
Is tearing myself away
And I know what all of my friends say
There's a danger in wanting too much
But she's such a temptation

I should be leaving
But I can't cut loose
I have my reasons for resistance
But I have no excuse
And I lose my composure
I could use some restraint
I never claimed to be a hero
And I never said I was a saint
She's such a temptation
It's driving me crazy
And it's my fascination
That's making me act this way
And I can just hear all my friends say
""Better watch out, you're losing your touch""
But she's such a temptation

Yes she is
She's such a temptation
Yes she is
Yes she is
She's such a temptation"
"Some people think 
That she's one of those mink-coated ladies
They say she wakes up at one
And makes the paparazzi run till dawn
She wines and dines with Argentines and Kuwaitis
After she sips margaritas on the White House lawn

That's not her style I can tell you
That ain't my woman
It's just not her style I can tell you
Because I'm her man

The papers say 
She was seen in L.A. with a stranger
She found a perfect body 
With a Maserati right outside

And then she chartered a Lear
When she heard her career was in danger
And gave the pilot 
Somethin' extra for a perfect ride

That's not her style I can tell you
That ain't my woman
It's just not her style I can tell you
Because I'm her man

Not that she's never d
One something crazy or done something wild
It's just that she's better 
At doing whatever suits her style
And that's not her style

I've read where it's said 
That she sleeps in a bed made of satin
She's had her face done in every place you can try
They say she gets a piece 

Of every lease in Manhattan
And says she's thirty 
When she's really pushing forty-five

That's not her style I can tell you
That ain't my woman
It's just not her style I can tell you
Because I'm her man"
"From a town known as Wheeling, West Virginia 
Rode a boy with a six gun in his hand 
And his daring life of crime 
Made him a legend in his time 
East and west of the Rio Grande. 

Well he started with a bank in Colorado 
In the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid 
And his age and his size 
Took the teller by surprise 
And, the word spread of Billy the kid 

Well he never traveled heavy 
Yes he always rode alone 
And he soon put many older guns to shame 
And he never had a sweetheart 
And he never had a home 
But the cowboy and the rancher knew his name 

Well he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma 
And the largest could not seem to track him down 
And it served his legend well 
For the folks they loved to tell about 
When Billy the kid came to town. 

Well one cold day a posse captured Billy 
And the judge said String him up for what he did.
And the cowboys and their kin 
Like the sea, came pouring in 
To watch the hanging of Billy the kid. 

Well he never traveled heavy 
Yes he always rode alone 
And he soon put many older guns to shame 
And he never had a sweetheart 
But he finally found a home 
Under the boot hill grave that bears his name. 

From a town known as Oyster Bay Long Island 
Rode a boy with a six pack in his hand 
And his daring life of crime 
Made him a legend in his time 
East and west of the Rio Grande."
"I was justified when I was five
Raisin' Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changin' now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back, oh, oh, oh

Eat meat on Friday, that's all right
Even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue, oh, oh, oh

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch oh, the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do oh

I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul, by dropping names
I don't like those! My God, what's that!
Oh, it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back.

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch oh, the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch, I can bitch 'cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move, the things that I do oh

I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch oh, the bitch is back

"Well I'm on the Downeaster Alexa
And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound
I have charted a course to the vineyard
But tonight I am Nantucket bound

We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday
Left this morning from the bell in Gardiner's Bay
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
Too proud to leave I worked my fingers to the bone

So I could own my Downeaster Alexa
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep

I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
I know there's fish out there but where God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I got people back on land who count on me

So if you see my Downeaster Alexa
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel

Now I drive my Downeaster Alexa
More and more miles from shore every year
Since they tell me I can't sell no stripers
And there's no luck in sword fishing here

I was a bay man like my father was before
Can't make a living as a bay man anymore
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea
But there ain't no island left for islanders like me

Yeah yeah yeah oh

Yeah yeah yeah oh

Yeah yeah yeah oh

Yeah yeah yeah oh"

"I am the entertainer

I let 'em rub my neck and I write 'em a check

They were the best years of my life
It was a beautiful song
But it ran too long
If you're gonna have a hit
You gotta make it fit

The idol of my age
I make all kinds of money
When I go on the stage
Ah, you've seen me in the papers
I've been in the magazines

I'll get put in the back in the discount rack

"Oh, the good life, full of fun seems to be the ideal
Mm, the good life lets you hide all the sadness you feel
You won't really fall in love for you can't take the chance
So please be honest with yourself, don't try to fake romance

It's the good life to be free and explore the unknown
Like the heartaches when you learn you must face them alone
Please remember I still want you, and in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up, kiss the good life goodbye"
"Flyin' east on a plane
Drinkin' all that free champagne
I guess I saw this comin' down the line
And I know it should be fun
But I think I should've packed my gun
Got that old suburban showdown in my mind

Sit around with the folks
Tell the same old tired jokes
Bored to death on Sunday afternoon
Mom and Dad, me and you
And the outdoor barbecue
Think I'm gonna hide out in my room

I've been gone for a while
Made some changes in my style
And they say you can't go home anymore
Well the streets all look the same
And I'll have to play the game
We'll all sit around in the kitchen chairs
With the TV on and the neighbors there

Out in the yard
Where my Daddy worked so hard
He never lets the crab grass grow too high
Oh, the place hasn't changed
And that's why I'm gonna feel so strange
But I'll have to face the music bye and bye

I've been gone for a while
Made some changes in my style
And they say you can't go home anymore
Well the streets all look the same
And I'll have to play the game
We'll all sit around in the kitchen chairs
With the TV on and the neighbors there

Drive into town
When this big bird touches down
I'm only comin' home to say goodbye
Then I'm gone with the wind
And I won't be seen again
Till that great suburban showdown in the sky
Till that great suburban showdown in the sky

"Advice is cheap you can take it from me
It's your's to keep cause opinions are free
Nobody knows about the trouble I've seen
Nobody's perfect, mister, nobody's clean
It coasts too much and takes too long to find out too late
Some words aren't heard 'til after they're spoken
Your role was protective, your soul was too defective
Some people just don't have a heart to be broken

We could've gone all the way to the Great Wall of China
If you only had a little more faith in me
In lieu of diamonds, gold, and platinum 
reminders will still shine bright
All the king's men and all the king's horse
Can't put you together the way you used to be
We could have been standing on the Great Wall Of China

You take a piece of whatever you touch
Too many pieces means you're touching too much
You never win if you can't play it straight
You only beat me if you get me to hate
It must be so lonely to think that you have only
Somebody elses life to live if they let you
I ain't too selective, but it don't take no detective
To find out how fast your friends will forget you 

We could have gone all the way to the Great Wall of China
Now all you're going to be is history
Help yourself, it's all you can eat at the Empire Diner tonight
You coulda had class, you coulda been a contender
Charlie, you shoulda looked out for me
You could have been standing, standing on the Great Wall of China

This was not your calling, just look how far you've fallen
I heard your story, man, you've got to be joking
Keep things in perspective, this is my true objective
Why tear this heart out if it's only been broken?

We could've gone all the way to the Great Wall of China
If you only had a little more faith in me
In lieu of diamonds, gold, and platinum 
reminders will still shine bright
All the king's men and all the king's horse
Can't put you together the way you used to be
We could have been standing on the Great Wall Of China"

I want to keep making love to you
While the night is still young

I'd like to settle down
Gettin' married and maybe have a child someday
I can see a time coming when I'm gonna throw my suitcase out
No more separations
Where you have to say goodnight to a telephone
Baby I've decided that ain't what this life is all about
Oh

While the night is still young
While I keep making love to you
While the night is still young
I want to try to make the world brand new
While the night is still young

Rock and Roll music was the only thing I
Ever gave a damn about
There was something that was missing
But I never used to wonder why
Now I know you're the one
Who's gonna make things right again
And I may lose the battle
But you're giving me the will to try
Oh

While the night is still young
Because the night is still young
I've got a lot of catching up I've got to do

While the night is still young
While the night is still young
Oh
While the night is still young
I want to try to make the world brand new
While the night is still young
I wanna keep making love to you
While the night is still young
While the night is still young
While the night is still young"
"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep

I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep

And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep

I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind

In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep

We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

In the middle of the night"
"Well, we all have a face
That we hide away forever
And we take them out
And show ourselves when everyone has gone
Some are satin, some are steel
Some are silk and some are leather
They're the faces of a stranger
But we'd love to try them on

Well, we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger
Did you ever let your lover
See the stranger in yourself

Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south every now and then
You've done it
Why can't someone else
You should know by now
You've been there yourself

Once I used to believe
I was such a great romancer
Then I came home to a woman
That I could not recognize
When I pressed her for a reason
She refused to even answer
It was then I felt the stranger
Kick me right between the eyes

Well, we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger
Did you ever let your lover
See the stranger in yourself

Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south every now and then
You've done it
Why can't someone else
You should know by now
You've been there yourself

You may never understand
How the stranger is inspired
But he isn't always evil
And he is not always wrong
Though you drown in good intentions
You will never quench the fire
You'll give in to your desire
When the stranger comes along"
"I have a feeling that's been goin on in your country right now is very much like the 60s. [Another man speaks Russian.] This song has been going around and around and my head since I've been here. [Another man speaks Russian.] This is called The Times They Are A-Changing. [Another man speaks Russian.]


Come gather 'round people wherever that you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
& accept it that soon U'll be drenched to the bone if your time to you is worth savin' 
Then U better start swimmin' or U'll sink like a stone 4 the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics who prophecise with your pen
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon for the wheels still in spin
And there's no tellin' now that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win for the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers & fathers throughout land & don't criticize what U can't understand
Your sons & your daughters R beyond your command your old road is rapidly agein'
So get out of the new one if U can't lend your hand 4 the times they are a-changin'

The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast, the slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past, the order is rapidly fadin'
And the first one now will later be last for the times they are a-changin'"
"This back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'
Two more hours to go
Yes, it's keeping me alive doin' nine to five
And I ain't got nothin to show
Pretty soon I'll be leavin'
With the wages I'm receivin'
But I know it's gonna be all right
Come on, babe, and take me away
We got some money to spend tonight

Pick me up at the station
Meet me at the train
Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes
I can't afford a vacation
But I can take the strain
Long as I can be with you
Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it

Yes, it's back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'
Two more hours to go
Seven long years for the same corporation
And I ain't got nothin' to show
And tonight when I'm leavin' I'll be just breakin' even
But I know it's gonna be all right

I shake off my blues when you put on your shoes
We got some money to spend tonight

Oh, I don't wanna stand here and sound accusin'
Everybody does their share of losin'
If I'm gonna lose it I might as well be doin' it right

Pick me up at the station
Meet me at the train
Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes
I can't afford a vacation
But I can take the strain
Long as I can be with you
Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it

Yes, it's back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'
Two more hours to go
Yes, it's keepin' me alive doin' nine to five

"
"We walked on the beach beside that old hotel
They're tearing it down now
But it's just as well
I haven't shown you everything a man can do
So stay with me baby
I've got plans for you

This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days
To hold on to
Cause we won't
Although we'll want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change
You've given me the best of you
And now I need the rest of you

Did you know that before you came into my life
It was some kind of miracle that I survived
Some day we will both look back
And have to laugh
We lived through a lifetime
And the aftermath

This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days
To hold on to
Cause we won't
Although we want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change
I know we've got to move somehow
But I don't want to lose you know

Sometimes it's so easy
To let a day
Slip on by
Without even seeing each other at all
But this is the time you'll turn back and so will I
And those will be the days you can never recall

And so we embrace again
Behind the dunes
This beach is cold
On winter afternoons
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun
I'm warm from the memory of days to come

This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days
To hold on to
But we won't
Although we'll want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change
You've given me the best of you
But now I need the rest of you"
"Didn't I say 
I wasn't ready for romance?
Didn't we promise 
We would only be friends?
And so we danced
Though it was only a slow dance,
I started breaking my promises right there and then

Didn't I swear 
There would be no complications?
Didn't you want 
Someone who's seen it all before?
Now that you're here
It's not the same situation,
Suddenly I don't remember the rules anymore

This night is mine
It's only you and I
Tomorrow is a long time away
This night can last forever

I've been around 
Someone like me should know better
Falling in love 
Would be the worst thing I could do
Didn't I say 
I needed time to forget her?
Aren't you running 
From someone who's not over you?

How many nights 
Have I been lonely without you?
I tell myself 
How much I really don't care
How many nights 
Have I been thinking about you?
Wanting to hold you 
But knowing you would not be there

But this night you're mine
It's only you and I
I'll tell you to forget yesterday
This night we are together

This night is mine
It's only you and I
Tomorrow is a long time away
This night can last forever

This night
Ooh
Ooh

Tomorrow is such a long time away
This night can last forever"
"The cold hands
The sad eyes
The dark Irish silence
It's so late
But I'll wait
Through the long night with you
With you

The warm tears
The bad dreams
The soft trembling shoulders
The old fears
But I'm here
Through the long night with you
With you

Oh, what has it cost you
I almost lost you
A long, long time ago
Oh, you should have told me
But you had to bleed to know

All your past sins
Are since past
You should be sleeping
It's all right
Sleep tight
Through the long night with me
With me

No, I didn't start it
You're broken hearted
From a long, long time ago
Oh, the way you hold me
Is all that I need to know

And it's so late
But I'll wait
Through the long night with you
With you


"
"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case,
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong.
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.

The storms are raging on a rolling sea,
Down on the highway of regret.
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I did make you happy, make your dreams come true, 
There's nothing that I would not do,
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love.
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love."
"I've been livin' for the moment
But I just can't have my way
And I'm afraid to go to sleep
Cause tomorrow is today

People tell me life is sweeter
But I don't hear what they say
Nothing comes to change my life
So tomorrow is today

I don't care to know the hour
Cause it's passing anyway
I don't have to see tomorrow
Cause I saw it yesterday

So I listen for an answer
But the feeling seems to stay
And what's the use of always dreaming
If tomorrow is today

Still I'm waiting for the morning
But it feels so far away
And you don't need the love I'm giving
So tomorrow is today

Oh, my.  Goin' to the river
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me
Made my bed, now I'm gonna lie in it
If you don't come, I'm sure gonna die in it
Too late.  Too much given
I've seen a lot of life and I'm damn sick of livin' it
I keep hopin' that you will pass my way

And some day if your dreams are leavin' you
I'll still believe in you

I don't care to know the hour
Cause it's passing anyway
I don't have to see tomorrow
Cause I saw it yesterday

Though I'm living and I'm singing
And although my hands still play
Soon enough it will all be over
Cause tomorrow is today"
"Hey Lord, take a look all around
And I'd a find where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
And things are gonna be alright with me

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that all her dreams are sweet
Said now, would ya guide her on the roads
And make them softer for her feet
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
Until she's home and here with me

Hey, Lord would ya look out for her tonight
If she is sleepin' under the sky
Said now, make sure the ground she's sleepin' on
Is always warm and dry
Um, don'tcha give her too much rain
Try to keep her away from pain
Because my baby hates to cry

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause it gets rough along the way
Said now, this song seems strange is just because
I don't know how to pray
Um, won'tcha give her peace of mind
And if you ever find the time
Won'tcha tell her I miss her everyday

Hey Lord, take a look all around
And I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
Until she's home and here with me
With me"
"Oh, sweet lady, runnin' like a stream 
You don't look back because you know your hands are clean 
You make believe the past was just a dream 
You make believe the past was just a dream 

Turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song 
I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long 

Oh, Elisa, you must begin again 
And all the roads that you have walked are comin' to an end 
I was your lover but I thought I was your friend 
I loved you but I thought I was your friend 

Turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song 
I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long 

Oh, sweet lady, stand beside the sea 
Maybe you will find a little time to think of me 
Won't you please remember what I tried so hard to be 
Yeah, remember what I tried so hard to be 

So turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song
And I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long 


"
"In the beginning
There was the cold and the night
Prophets and angels gave us the fire and the light
Man was triumphant
Armed with the faith and the will
Even the darkest ages couldn't kill

Too many kingdoms
Too many flags on the field
So many battles, so many wounds to be healed
Time is relentless
Only true love perseveres
It's been a long time and now I'm with you
After two thousand years

This is our moment
Here at the crossroads of time
We hope our children carry our dreams down the line
They are the vintage
What kind of life will they live?
Is this a curse or a blessing that we give?

Sometimes I wonder
Why are we so blind to fate?
Without compassion, there can be no end to hate
No end to sorrow
Caused by the same endless fears
Why can't we learn from all we've been through
After two thousand years?

There will be miracles
After the last war is won
Science and poetry rule in the new world to come
Prophets and angels
Gave us the power to see
What an amazing future there will be

And in the evening
After the fire and the light
One thing is certain: Nothing can hold back the night
Time is relentless
And as the past disappears
We're on the verge of all things new
We are two thousand years"
"I never ask you where you go
After I leave you in the morning
We go our different ways to separate situations
It's not that easy anymore

Today I do what must be done
I give my time to total strangers
But now it feels as though the day goes on forever
MOre than it ever did before

CHORUS
Until the night, until the night
I just might make it
Until the night, until the night
When I see you again

Now you're afraid that we have changed
And I'm afraid we're getting older
So many broken hearts, so many lonely faces
So many lovers come and gone

I'll have my fears like every man
You'll have your tears like every woman
Today we'll be unsure, is this what we believe in
And wonder how can we go on

CHORUS

When the sun goes down
And the day is over
When the last of the light has gone
As they pour into the street
I will be getting closer
As the cars turn their headlights on
While they're closing it down
We're gonna open it up
And while they're going to sleep
We'll just be starting to touch
I'm just beginning to feel
I'm just beginning to give
I'm just beginning to feel
I'm just beginning to live
Before I leave you again
Before the light of the dawn
Before this evening can end
I have been waiting so long

CHORUS

"Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mama never told her why

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

And when she knows
What she wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine

She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love
With an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can

"Slow down, you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart, then tell me
Why are you still so afraid?

Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
You've got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day

But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you get old
You're gonna kick off before you even
Get halfway through
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you

Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be
Before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight
Tonight,
Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know
You can't always see when you're right. you're right

But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true

And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile

You're gonna kick off before you even get half through

"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true"
"Well I see you in the morning
Putting on your pretty clothes
And I watch you do your make-up
Like they do in all those fashion shows
Then you turn to me so that I can see
If you put yourself together right
Then you go away and you're gone all day
But I know you're coming home tonight
And when you're home, 
Darling all you've got to be is you
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do

Well it's alright if you're tired 
When your day is done
You can see when you look at me, 
You're not the only one
It's a cold, cruel world for a working girl
But you can't let them see you cry
It's a fact of life, now man and wife
Work full time to just get by
And when we're home all 
It's gonna be is me and you
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do

I've done some strange things I
Never thought I'd do before
But if the strain brings happiness, 
More or less.
More or less.

Then I don't mind masquerading 
With all those other fools
I don't mind the games I'm playing,
Because I've learned the rules
And when times are tough, I've got just enough
If you're standing right by my side
Darling more and more I get hungry for
All the ways you keep me satisfied
On our own there ain't nothing 
That we can't get through
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do

Then I don't mind masquerading with all those other fools
I don't mind the games I'm playing,
Because I've learned the rules
It doesn't matter when we're home, all alone
All we've got to be is me and you
On our own there ain't nothing 
That we can't get through
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do

Swing that hammer and break that stone
Push those buttons and answer that phone
Coffee in the morning and martinis at night
Everybody's working up a big appetite
Do as the Romans do."
"Where's the orchestra? 
Wasn't this supposed to be a musical? 
Here I am 
In the balcony, 
How the hell could I have missed the overture? 

I like the scenery 
Even though, I have absolutely no, idea at all,
What is being said, despite the dialogue, 
There's the leading man 

The movie star who never faced an audience 
Where's the orchestra? 
After all, this is my big night on the town 
My introduction to the theatre crowd 

I assumed that the show would have a song 
So I was wrong 
At least I understand 
All the innuendo and the irony 

And I appreciate, 
The roles the actors played 
The point the author made 
And after the closing lines, 

And after the curtain calls,
The curtain falls
On empty chairs, 
Where's the orchestra?"
"Of all the people in the world that I know
You're the best place to go
When I cry, when I cry

I never asked for much before, not before
Things are changed; I need more
Tell me why, Judy, why?

I never thought that she would say
Say goodbye; but she did
And now I wanna die.  I wanna die

I never thought that I would need, need a friend
But I did, in the end
Tell me why, Judy, why

Oh, what a scene
It's wrong for her to hang me up this way
Oh, where you been?
'Cause it's so hard to make it through the day

A man my age is very young, so I'm told
Why do I feel so old?
Tell me why, Judy, why?

Oh, what a scene
It's wrong for her to hang me up this way
Oh, where you been?
'Cause it's so hard to make it through the day

There's no tomorrow 'cause my dreams did not last
So I live in the past
Tell me why, Judy, why?"
"One minute I'm in Central Park
Then I'm down on Delancey Street
From the Bow'ry to St. Marks
There's a syncopated beat

Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I'm streetwise, I can improvise
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I'm streetsmart, I've got New York City heart

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime
But I got street savoire faire

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just bebopulation
And I got street saviore faire

The rhythm of the city
But once you get it down
Then you can own this town
You can wear the crown

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime
But I got street savoire faire

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just bebopulation
And I got street saviore faire

Ev'rything goes
Ev'rything fits
They love me at the Chelsea
They adore me at the Ritz

Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
And even when I cross that line
I got street savoire faire"
"I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main roads
Searchin' in the sun
For another overload

I hear you singin' in the wires
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Will never stand the strain

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

"Today I'm livin' like a rich man's son
Tomorrow mornin' I could be a bum
It doesn't matter which direction, though
I know a woman in New Mexico
Chorus:
Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong
Oh, and if I don't have a car, I'll hitch
I got a thumb and she's a son of a bitch
I do my writing on my road guitar
And make a living at a piano bar, oh
Chorus
Lightning and thunder
Flashed across the roads we drove upon
Oh, but it's clear skies we're under
When I am together, when I sing the song
Chorus
Oh, fun ain't easy if it ain't free
Too many people got a hold on me
But I know something that they don't know
I know a woman in New Mexico
Chorus 3x and fade
"
"You can make me free
You can make me smile
You can make me be
Like a little child

You can melt the ice that chills my body
You can dry my every tear
You make the lonely hours disappear

You can make me free
You can make me rise
You can make me see
So open up my eyes

Don't you know my only real moments
Are the ones I spend with you
How I long to drink some wine again with you

I can take to the skies
I can soar like a bird with its heart full of song
Won't you color my eyes
I've been waiting so long

You can make me free
You can make me cry
You can make it so much better
If you would only try

And if I must wait a lonely lifetime
Until I am with you, my love
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of

I can take to the skies
I can soar like a bird with his heart full of song
Won't you cover my eyes
I've been waiting so long

You can make me free
You can make me cry
You can make it so much better
If you would only try

And if I must wait a lonely lifetime
Until I am with you, my love
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of

I can take to the skies
I can soar like a bird with his heart full of song
Won't you cover my eyes
I've been waiting so long

You can make me free
You can make me cry
You can make it so much better
If you would only try

And if I must wait a lonely lifetime
Until I am with you, my love
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of

You can make me free
You can make me cry
You can make it so much better
If you would only try"
"Ah, you look so good to me 
With my eyes open wide, I can see 
Ah, you feel so good to me 
And it's so good when you're here 'cause I'm free 

Feelin' the glory from that smile upon your face 
It's liftin' me high above my ordinary place 
And I am so happy when I'm in your warm embrace 

Ah, you look so good to me 
With my eyes open wide, I can see 
Ah, you feel so good to me 
And who knows what your next move will be? 

Ah, you look so good to me 
With my eyes open wide, I can see 
Ah, you feel so good to me 
And it's so good when you're here 'cause I'm free

"Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting any one
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
You may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right"

"Don't get me wrong,
I ain't the kind
To turn away from you
When something's on your mind.

But you have to know,
You just have to see,
I'm having my troubles, babe, 
And they're all too much for me.

You picked a real bad time 
To spoil my concentration
You picked a real bad time 
To pass along the bad news
Tell me, why you try
To give me aggravation
You picked a real bad time
'Cause this man's got the blues

Don't get me wrong,
You're not alone
And I'd like to help you
But I've got problems of my own

It's a bitter phase
I'm going through
And I can run from strangers, darlin', 
But I just can't hide from you.

You picked a real bad time 
To spoil my concentration
You picked a real bad time 
To pass along the bad news
Tell me, why you try
To give me aggravation
You picked a real bad time
And I got time to lose

Ain't it the truth
When they say
That the only thing worth dying for
Is our freedom
Ain't it the proof 
That someday
We will all be lying on our backs
Free at last from income tax

Don't you get me wrong
The mood won't last
And I'll be myself again 
Soon as this pain has passed

And I'm standing here,
Don't ask me how,
I'll make it up to you, 
Someday but not right now

You picked a real bad time 
To spoil my concentration
You picked a real bad time 
To pass along the bad news
You caused a real hard line 
To invade my isolation
You picked a real bad time
'Cause this man's got the blues

Ain't it the truth 
When they say
All you need is love but all you'll want is forgiveness
Ain't it the proof 
That someday
Even love will not provide for man
The way that life insurance can

You picked a real bad time 
To spoil my concentration
You picked a real bad time 
To pass along the bad news
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Why you tryin' to give me aggravation
You picked a real bad time, cause this man's got the blues."
"When you look into my eyes 
And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul 
It always comes as a surprise 
When I feel my withered roots begin to grow 

Well I never had a place 
That I could call my very own 
But that's all right my love 
'Cause you're my home

When you touch my weary head 
And you tell me everything will be all right 
You say use my body for your bed 
And my love will keep you warm throughout the night 

Well I'll never be a stranger 
And I'll never be alone 
Wherever we're together 
That's my home

Home could be the Pennsylvania turnpike 
Indiana's early morning dew 
High up in the hills of California 
Home is just another word for you 

Well I never had a place that I could call my very own 
But that's all right my love 'cause you're my home 

If I travel all my life 
And I never get stop and settle down 
Long as I have you by my side 
There's a roof above and good walls all around 
You're my castle, you're my cabin 
And my instant pleasure dome 
I need you in my house 
'Cause you're my home
You're my home"

Sometimes that's what it takes
You're only human, you're allowed to make your share of mistakes

You better believe there will be times in your life
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool
So take it from me you'll learn more from you accidents
Than anything you could ever learn at school

Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll get your second wind
It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again
It's alright, it's alright

Though you feel your heart break
You're only human, your gonna have to deal with heartache
Just like a boxer in a title fight
You got to walk in that ring all alone
You're not the only one who's made mistakes
But they're the only things that you can truly call your own

Don't forget your second wind
Wait in your corner until that breeze blows in

You've been keeping to yourself these days
Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die
That emotion can be so strong
But hold on
Till that old second wind comes along

You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself
It's alright, it's alright
Sometimes that's all it takes
We're only human
We're supposed to make mistakes
But I survived all those long lonely days
When it seemed I did not have a friend
Cause all I needed was a little faith
So I could"

"It's a little bit funny this feeling inside 
I'm not one of those who can easily hide 
I don't have much money but boy if I did 
I'd buy a big house where we both could live 
If I was a sculptor but then again no 
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show 
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do 

My gift is my song 
And this one's for you 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 

How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss 
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross 
But the sun's been quite kind 
While I wrote this song 
It's for people like you that 
Keep it turned on 
So excuse me forgetting 

But these things I do 
You see I've forgotten 
If they're green or they're blue 
Anyway the thing is what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but 
Now that it's done 

I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 
How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
I hope you don't mind

How wonderful life is while you're in the world"

Though he's bathed in sweat he hasn't lost his style
Ali don't you go downtown
You gave away another round for free

Me, I'm just another face at Zanzibar
But the waitress always serves a secret smile
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me, for me

I've got the old man's car

I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight that's where I'll be, I'll be

But the Yankees grab the headline every time
Melodrama's so much fun
In black and white for everyone to see

Me, I'm trying just to get to second base
And I'd steal it if she only gave the sign
She's gonna give the go head
The inning isn't over yet for me, for me

I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
